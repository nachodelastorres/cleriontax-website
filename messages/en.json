    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "Do I have to declare my cryptocurrencies even if I haven't sold them?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you have cryptocurrencies abroad worth more than €50,000, you must declare them in form 720. Additionally, any sale, exchange, or use of cryptocurrencies generates a capital alteration that must be declared in the income tax return, regardless of whether you withdraw the money or not."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How does AEAT calculate gains and losses in cryptocurrencies?",
        "answer": "AEAT applies the FIFO (First In, First Out) criterion: the first cryptocurrencies you bought are considered the first ones sold. Each sale or exchange generates a capital gain or loss that must be calculated with the acquisition price and the transfer price. We apply this criterion exactly in all our reports."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Do DeFi operations (staking, liquidity pools, farming) have tax implications?",
        "answer": "Yes. Staking and farming rewards are considered capital income. Swaps between tokens, even in DeFi, are exchanges that generate capital gains or losses. Liquidity provision may involve taxable events depending on how it's structured. At Cleriontax, we analyze each DeFi protocol to tax-classify each operation."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Why do automatic software programs give incorrect results?",
        "answer": "Automatic tools don't understand the Spanish tax context and don't correctly reconcile movements between wallets, duplicates, or internal transfers. Additionally, they don't correctly classify complex DeFi operations (such as wrapping, bridging, or multichain staking). At Cleriontax, we manually review each operation and correct these errors to guarantee a 100% accurate report."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What information do I need to order my tax report?",
        "answer": "We need CSV files from all your exchanges (Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.), the addresses of your on-chain wallets (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.), and any record of operations on DeFi platforms. It's also useful if you indicate the approximate dates of purchase of your first assets if you don't have complete records."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How long does the process take and what is the price?",
        "answer": "The time depends on transaction volume: from 3-5 days for simple cases to 2-3 weeks for very complex portfolios with thousands of DeFi transactions. The price adjusts according to complexity, number of platforms, and data volume. Request your quote without obligation and we'll give you an accurate estimate within 24-48h."

              "a": "Automatic software applies generic algorithms that do not account for the specificities of Spanish tax regulations, do not properly reconcile internal wallet movements and generate errors in the classification of complex DeFi operations. We apply human tax criteria, manual review of critical operations and personalized data modeling for each case. Our approach combines technology with tax expertise, ensuring traceability, accuracy and real regulatory compliance."

              "q": "Do you only work with cryptocurrencies or also with stocks and other assets?",
              "a": "We work with any type of financial asset: cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, futures, options, bonds, investment funds and alternative assets. Our specialization lies in the complexity of data analysis and tax engineering, not in a specific asset class. If you have a mixed portfolio with multiple data sources, we can consolidate it fully."

            {
              "q": "How long does the full process take from first contact to delivery of the tax report?",
              "a": "It depends on complexity. Simple cases with few platforms and moderate volume can be completed in 5–7 business days. Complex portfolios with more than 50 data sources, hundreds of thousands of transactions and DeFi operations may require 2 to 4 weeks. In the initial evaluation we will give you a precise timeline based on your specific case."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do you offer advice on which cryptocurrencies to buy or how to optimize my investment strategy?",
              "a": "No. We do not offer investment advice or recommendations on which assets to buy, sell or hold. Our service is strictly technical-tax: financial data analysis, calculation of tax obligations, preparation of AEAT forms and compliance guidance. For investment decisions, we recommend consulting an independent financial advisor."

We apply certified FIFO methodology, full traceability of every calculation and auditable supporting documentation. If we detect errors after delivery, we correct them at no additional cost. Each report includes technical justification and applicable regulatory references."
