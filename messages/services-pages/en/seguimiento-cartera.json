We connect your on-chain wallets and exchange accounts to professional tools like CoinTracking, configure personalized dashboards and give you access to automated reports of balances, historical performance and configurable alerts. This service is ideal if you have a portfolio of moderate complexity (less than 10 platforms, up to 10,000 annual transactions) and want continuous monitoring without need for advanced manual processing. If your portfolio exceeds these limits or you have complex DeFi operations, we will recommend our Portfolio Analysis service instead. This service does not include tax calculations or AEAT form preparation: it is exclusively monitoring and automated reporting. Do you want to have your portfolio under control at all times? Let's talk."

          "q": "Is it safe to connect my exchanges through API keys?",
          "a": "Yes, as long as you use read-only API keys without trading or withdrawal permissions. CoinTracking and similar tools can only read your balances and transactions, never operate with your funds. We teach you to generate API keys with minimum necessary permissions. We never ask for direct login credentials."
        },
        {
          "q": "What tool do you use for tracking?",
          "a": "Mainly CoinTracking, which is the most complete and compatible with most exchanges and blockchains. In specific cases, we can use alternatives like Koinly, Accointing or Zerion according to your needs. We advise you on which is most suitable for your case."
        },
        {
          "q": "How often is data updated?",
          "a": "Depends on your plan on the chosen tool. CoinTracking offers synchronization from hourly to daily. For portfolios with active trading, we recommend update every 6-12 hours. For HODLers, daily update is sufficient. Frequency affects subscription cost on the tool."

        {
          "q": "Does this service include tax calculations or AEAT form preparation?",
          "a": "No. This service is exclusively real-time monitoring. If you need FIFO calculations, tax settlement preparation or AEAT forms, you must contract our Tax Settlements service. CoinTracking can generate automatic tax reports, but they are not valid for Spain without expert manual review."

          "q": "What happens if my portfolio is too complex for CoinTracking?",
          "a": "If during evaluation we detect that you have complex DeFi operations, more than 50 data sources, hundreds of thousands of transactions or cases that CoinTracking does not process correctly, we will recommend our Portfolio Analysis service instead. We don't force automated tools when we know they will generate errors."

          "q": "Can I cancel the service at any time?",
          "a": "Initial setup is a one-time service with single payment. The CoinTracking (or other tool) subscription you contract directly and can cancel whenever you want. We only charge for initial setup, training and support during the first 30 days. Subsequent support is billed on demand if you need it."
