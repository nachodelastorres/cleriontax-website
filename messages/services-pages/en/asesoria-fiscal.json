      "body": "Specialized tax advisory is a technical consulting service for investors who need to resolve specific questions about crypto asset taxation without requiring a complete analysis or settlement service. We work in personalized 1:1 session format where we review your case, answer specific questions about applicable regulations, AEAT form filing criteria, interpretation of DGT binding consultations and any technical-tax aspect related to cryptocurrencies, stocks or digital assets. It is important to note that we do NOT offer investment advice: we will not tell you which assets to buy, sell or when to do so. Our approach is exclusively technical and tax-oriented: how to correctly declare what you have already done, how to interpret applicable regulations for your case and how to prepare documentation for Tax Agency requirements. This service is ideal if you already have basic tax knowledge but need expert validation, or if you have received a request from the AEAT and need technical help to respond. Do you have specific tax questions about your crypto assets? Let's talk."

        "<strong>Experience with Tax Agency requirements:</strong> we have helped dozens of clients respond to AEAT requests about crypto assets. We know what documentation they request, how to structure responses and what errors to avoid.",
        "<strong>No unnecessary jargon:</strong> we explain complex tax concepts in an understandable way. Our goal is for you to understand the regulations applicable to your case, not to impress you with useless technicalities.",

We do not offer investment advice, we do not file forms for you (except express coordination) and we do not guarantee results before the Tax Agency (no one can guarantee it). We offer expert technical judgment, nothing more and nothing less."

We do not resolve questions about which assets to buy or investment strategies."

          "a": "No. We do not offer investment advice under any circumstances. Our service is exclusively technical-tax: how to correctly declare what you have already done, how to interpret applicable regulations and how to comply with your tax obligations. For investment decisions, consult with an independent financial advisor."

          "q": "Do you file the forms with the AEAT or do you only advise?",
          "a": "By default, we only advise. You file the forms using your digital certificate or Cl@ve PIN. If you need a certified tax advisor to file for you with representation, we can coordinate it as a specific additional service, but it requires power of attorney procedures and has separate cost."

          "q": "How long does a typical advisory session last?",
          "a": "Between 60 and 90 minutes depending on the complexity of your consultation. Simple occasional consultations can be resolved in 60 minutes. Cases with multiple questions, extensive document review or Tax Agency requests usually require 90 minutes or more. We indicate estimated duration after evaluating your initial case."

          "q": "Can I contract several sessions if I have a complex case?",
          "a": "Yes. We offer session packs with discount if you anticipate needing continuous follow-up. You can also book individual sessions as needed. If your case is very complex and requires deep data analysis or complete tax preparation, you probably benefit more from our Tax Settlements service instead of multiple advisory sessions."
        },

          "q": "What guarantees do you offer on the tax recommendations you give?",
          "a": "We offer expert technical judgment based on current regulations, DGT binding consultations and applicable case law. However, tax interpretation always has a component of judgment and can evolve with regulatory changes or new resolutions. We cannot guarantee that the Tax Agency will always accept our interpretations, but we do guarantee that we apply the best available technical judgment at each moment and we justify each recommendation normatively."
