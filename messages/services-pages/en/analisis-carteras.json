It is designed for investors who operate across multiple platforms simultaneously, manage high-complexity operations and need to consolidate dispersed data from exchanges, brokers, on-chain wallets and DeFi protocols. We apply advanced data engineering to integrate heterogeneous sources, detect duplicates, reconcile internal movements and generate consolidated reports with complete traceability. This service is not direct tax filing: it is the essential preliminary step when your data is too complex for automated tools and you need a solid foundation before preparing your tax obligations. If your portfolio presents high operational complexity, multiple blockchain ecosystems or sophisticated investment structures, this is the service you need. Shall we talk?"

Portfolios with high complexity, multiple sources and massive volumes may require between 3 and 5 weeks.

We have integrated protocols on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Cosmos, Osmosis, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism and other networks. If the protocol has a subgraph on The Graph, verified contract or public API, we can extract the data. In very specific cases, we can deploy own nodes if necessary."
