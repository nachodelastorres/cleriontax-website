      "body": "At Cleriontax we specialize in two critical areas for investors with complex portfolios: financial data analysis and tax engineering. We work with investors operating across multiple platforms, exchanges, on-chain wallets and DeFi protocols, who need to consolidate thousands of transactions into verifiable tax reports compatible with the AEAT. Our approach combines advanced data processing technology with deep knowledge of Spanish tax regulations, applying FIFO, transaction classification and full traceability in every report we produce. We are not a generalist tax agency nor an automatic software: we are specialists at solving tax complexity through applied data engineering."

          "q": "What differentiates your service from automatic software like Koinly or CoinTracking?",
          "a": "Automatic software applies generic algorithms that do not account for the specificities of Spanish tax regulations, do not properly reconcile internal wallet movements and generate errors in the classification of complex DeFi operations. We apply human tax criteria, manual review of critical operations and personalized data modeling for each case. Our approach combines technology with tax expertise, ensuring traceability, accuracy and real regulatory compliance."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you only work with cryptocurrencies or also with stocks and other assets?",
          "a": "We work with any type of financial asset: cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, futures, options, bonds, investment funds and alternative assets. Our specialization lies in the complexity of data analysis and tax engineering, not in a specific asset class. If you have a mixed portfolio with multiple data sources, we can consolidate it fully."
        },
        {
          "q": "How long does the full process take from first contact to delivery of the tax report?",
          "a": "It depends on complexity. Simple cases with few platforms and moderate volume can be completed in 5–7 business days. Complex portfolios with more than 50 data sources, hundreds of thousands of transactions and DeFi operations may require 2 to 4 weeks. In the initial evaluation we will give you a precise timeline based on your specific case."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you offer advice on which cryptocurrencies to buy or how to optimize my investment strategy?",
          "a": "No. We do not offer investment advice or recommendations on which assets to buy, sell or hold. Our service is strictly technical-tax: financial data analysis, calculation of tax obligations, preparation of AEAT forms and compliance guidance. For investment decisions, we recommend consulting an independent financial advisor."
        },
        {
          "q": "What guarantees do you offer on the accuracy of tax calculations?",
          "a": "All our tax reports are reviewed by certified tax advisors specialized in crypto assets. We apply certified FIFO methodology, full traceability of every calculation and auditable supporting documentation. If we detect errors after delivery, we correct them at no additional cost. Each report includes technical justification and applicable regulatory references."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you guarantee the confidentiality and security of my financial data?",
          "a": "We process all data in our own secure environments without uploading it to third-party cloud services. We apply end-to-end encryption, role-restricted access and strict data retention policies. We sign confidentiality agreements with every client and comply with GDPR. Your data is deleted from our systems once the legally required retention period ends."
