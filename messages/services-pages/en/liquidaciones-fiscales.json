      "body": "Tax settlement preparation is the final step after consolidating and analyzing your data. This service is designed for investors who need to comply with their tax obligations by correctly applying AEAT and DGT criteria. We calculate capital gains and losses using FIFO criteria, classify capital income (staking, lending, airdrops), prepare forms 100, 721 and 714, and generate auditable supporting documentation for any Tax Agency request. We do not offer investment advice or recommendations on which assets to buy or sell: our approach is exclusively technical-tax. We work with you to optimize your declaration within the legal framework, applying all permitted loss compensations and simulating alternative scenarios when appropriate. If you have complex operations in cryptocurrencies, international stocks or multi-level tax structures, this is the service you need. Do you have questions about how to declare your crypto assets this year? Let's talk."

          "q": "What is the difference between forms 100, 721 and 714?",
          "a": "Form 100 is the income tax return (IRPF), where you declare all your gains, losses and income for the tax year. Form 721 is informative: you declare balances of cryptocurrencies abroad if they exceed €50,000 as of December 31. Form 714 is also informative: you declare your total assets if you exceed certain thresholds. Each has different deadlines and requirements. We advise you on which apply to your case."
        },
        {
          "q": "What documentation do I need to provide to prepare my tax settlement?",
          "a": "We need CSV files from all your exchanges with complete operation history, on-chain wallet addresses to extract transactions, information on initial purchases if you have assets from years ago, and any document justifying special operations (airdrops, hard forks, mining income). If you already have consolidated data from our portfolio analysis service, that is sufficient."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you apply FIFO criteria if I have operations since 2015?",
          "a": "We reconstruct your complete history from the first documented purchase. We apply strict FIFO: the first units purchased are the first sold. If you have gaps in your historical records, we apply conservative valuation methods and document applied assumptions. In cases of closed exchanges or old wallets without records, we work with available information and justify methodology."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I fiscally optimize my declaration legally?",
          "a": "Yes. Within the legal framework, optimization strategies exist: compensation of capital losses with gains, temporal imputation of operations in different years if possible, use of applicable deductions, and planning of staggered sales to avoid tax bracket jumps. We simulate scenarios and explain pros/cons of each option. We do not offer tax evasion or illegal strategies."

          "q": "What happens if the AEAT requests me after filing my declaration?",
          "a": "All our reports include complete supporting documentation and total traceability of calculations. If you receive a request, we help you prepare the response by providing technical justification, operation detail and applicable regulatory references. We offer post-filing support throughout the entire tax season at no additional cost if the request refers to data we processed."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does this service include the actual filing of forms with the AEAT?",
          "a": "No. We prepare all forms ready to file, but the actual filing using digital certificate or Cl@ve PIN is done by you or your trusted tax advisor. We deliver files importable into Renta Web, PDFs ready for signature and step-by-step filing guide. If you need a tax advisor to file for you, we can coordinate it through our advisory service."
