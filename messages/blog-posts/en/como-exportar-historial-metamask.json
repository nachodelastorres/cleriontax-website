  "content": "**Metamask** is the most widely used cryptocurrency wallet in the world, with more than 30 million active users interacting daily with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum and dozens of blockchain networks.\n\nBut when the time comes to prepare your **income tax return** or respond to a request from the AEAT, many users discover a fundamental problem: Metamask does not have a native history export function like centralized exchanges.\n\nExporting your Metamask data incorrectly or incompletely can result in:\n\n- Incorrect tax returns that lead to penalties\n- Inability to justify the origin of your cryptocurrencies to the Tax Agency\n- Loss of traceability over complex DeFi operations\n- Incorrect calculations of the mandatory FIFO method in Spain\n- Omission of swaps, airdrops or yields that must be declared\n\nIn this **complete and updated guide for 2025**, we explain step by step how to correctly export all your Metamask operations, which tools to use, how to interpret the data and how to organize them for your tax return before the AEAT.\n\n---\n\n## Why exporting your Metamask history is different (and more complex)\n\nUnlike exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase, **Metamask is a non-custodial wallet**. This means that your private keys are under your exclusive control, but it also means there is no centralized server that stores and provides you with a transaction history in CSV format.\n\nAll your transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which is an advantage for traceability, but it means you must use block explorers or specialized tools to extract and process that information.\n\n### Key differences between Metamask and centralized exchanges\n\n| Feature | Exchange (Binance, Coinbase) | Metamask |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Custody type** | Custodial | Non-custodial |\n| **Native CSV export** | Yes | No |\n| **Centralized history** | On the exchange's servers | On blockchain |\n| **Multiple networks** | Usually one | Multiple (ETH, Polygon, BSC...) |\n| **DeFi operations** | Limited | Full |\n| **Tax complexity** | Medium | High |\n\n### Tax obligations with wallets like Metamask\n\nAs a Metamask user in Spain, your tax obligations are exactly the same as with any other form of cryptocurrency holding. Every time you sell, exchange or convert cryptocurrencies via a swap on a DEX, you generate a capital gain or loss that must be declared in [Form 100 applying the FIFO method](/blog/como-declarar-criptomonedas-renta-2025).\n\nIf the total balance of your cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets such as Metamask exceeds €50,000 on 31 December, you are required to file the [Form 721 for cryptocurrency declaration](/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas). Non-custodial wallets are considered \"abroad\" for the purposes of this form.\n\nIn addition, yields generated by staking, yield farming, airdrops and other DeFi operations must be declared as investment income, as we explain in our [DeFi taxation guide](/blog/fiscalidad-defi-espana).\n\n---\n\n## Types of operations you must export from Metamask\n\nMetamask records multiple types of operations, each with different tax implications. For a complete tax return, you need to identify and export all relevant transaction types.\n\n### 1. Incoming transfers (Receive)\n\nThese include cryptocurrency deposits from exchanges, transfers from other wallets, airdrops received and reward tokens from staking or farming.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Deposits from your own exchanges or wallets **do not generate taxation** (they are internal movements)\n- Airdrops received **must be valued at the market price** at the time of receipt\n- Rewards from staking or farming are **investment income**\n\n### 2. Outgoing transfers (Send)\n\nThese include sending cryptocurrencies to exchanges, transfers to other wallets and payments for goods or services.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Transfers to your own exchanges or wallets **are not taxable** if you can prove you control both addresses\n- Payments for goods or services **do generate capital gains/losses**\n- Each transfer includes **gas fees** that may be deductible\n\n### 3. Swaps on DEXs (Uniswap, SushiSwap, 1inch, etc.)\n\nToken swaps performed directly from Metamask or by connecting the wallet to DeFi protocols are operations with high tax relevance.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Each swap is a **taxable exchange** that generates a capital gain or loss\n- Even swaps between two cryptocurrencies (ETH → USDC) are taxable\n- Gas fees paid in these operations are deductible expenses\n- It is essential to understand the [correct tax treatment of each type of operation](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas)\n\n### 4. Contract approvals (Approvals)\n\nWhen you connect Metamask to a DeFi protocol, you usually have to approve that the smart contract can spend your tokens.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Approvals themselves **do not generate taxation**\n- However, they consume gas, which is indeed an expense\n- It is important to record them for full traceability\n\n### 5. Complex DeFi operations\n\nThese include providing liquidity in pools (Uniswap, Curve), deposits in lending protocols (Aave, Compound), token staking, reward claims and bridging operations between networks.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Each type of operation has a specific tax treatment\n- Rewards must be declared as income when received\n- Impermanent loss in liquidity pools can be offset against gains\n\n### 6. Failed transactions\n\nTransactions that fail due to lack of gas or contract errors are also recorded on the blockchain.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- **They do not generate capital gains or losses** (there was no exchange)\n- The gas consumed **is a real expense** that can be documented\n\n---\n\n## Methods to export your Metamask history\n\nThere are several ways to obtain your Metamask operations history, from manual methods to automated tools. Let’s look at each option.\n\n### Method 1: Blockchain explorers (Etherscan and similar)\n\nThe most direct way to obtain your history is by consulting the official blockchain explorers of each network where you have operated.\n\n**For Ethereum (mainnet):**\n\n1. Go to [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io)\n2. Paste your Metamask wallet address into the search bar\n3. You will see all your transactions on the Ethereum network\n4. Click on \"Download CSV Export\" (bottom right corner of the table)\n5. Select the date range\n6. Download the CSV file\n\n**Explorers by network:**\n\n| Network | Explorer | URL |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ethereum | Etherscan | etherscan.io |\n| Polygon | Polygonscan | polygonscan.com |\n| BSC | BscScan | bscscan.com |\n| Arbitrum | Arbiscan | arbiscan.io |\n| Optimism | Optimistic Etherscan | optimistic.etherscan.io |\n| Avalanche | Snowtrace | snowtrace.io |\n| Base | Basescan | basescan.org |\n\nThis method has some **important limitations**: you must export manually from each network where you have operated, the CSVs only include basic transactions without the internal DEX swaps, they do not show the EUR price at the time of the operation, internal contract operations may not appear, and it requires manually consolidating multiple files.\n\nHowever, it has **significant advantages**: you obtain data directly from the blockchain with maximum reliability, it is completely free and it includes the transaction hash for later verification\n\n### Method 2: Portfolio tracking tools\n\nPortfolio tracking tools such as DeBank or Zerion can display your history in a more visual way, although they have limitations for tax export. In our [guide to tools for tracking cryptocurrencies](/blog/herramientas-rastrear-criptomonedas) we analyse the best options available.\n\n**DeBank:**\n\n1. Go to [debank.com](https://debank.com)\n2. Connect your wallet or paste your address\n3. Go to the \"History\" section\n4. You will see all your transactions across the supported networks\n\n**Zerion:**\n\n1. Go to [zerion.io](https://zerion.io)\n2. Connect your Metamask\n3. Navigate to \"History\"\n4. View your multichain history\n\nThese tools have **important limitations for tax use**: they do not have a direct CSV export oriented to tax reporting, they do not calculate gains and losses according to the Spanish FIFO method, and they do not generate reports compatible with AEAT requirements.\n\nNevertheless, they offer **advantages for visualization**: they allow you to see your activity across multiple networks in a unified way, automatically identify the DeFi protocols you have interacted with, and are completely free\n\n### Method 3: Specialized tax tools (Koinly, CoinTracking)\n\nTax tools allow you to import your Metamask wallet and generate tax reports, although they require manual review to adapt them to Spanish regulations.\n\n**Koinly:**\n\n1. Create an account at koinly.io\n2. Go to \"Wallets\" → \"Add Wallet\"\n3. Select \"Metamask\" or \"Ethereum Wallet\"\n4. Paste your public address\n5. Koinly will automatically synchronize your history\n6. Repeat for each network (Polygon, BSC, etc.)\n\n**CoinTracking:**\n\n1. Create an account at cointracking.info\n2. Go to \"Enter Coins\" → \"Import from Exchange\"\n3. Select \"Blockchain Import\" → \"Ethereum\"\n4. Paste your address\n5. Import the transactions\n\nThese tools present certain **limitations for Spanish users**: the reports labelled as \"Spain\" do not fully adapt to AEAT criteria, complex DeFi operations are often misclassified, they require a paid plan to export full reports and may need significant manual review and correction.\n\nDespite this, they offer **considerable advantages**: they allow automatic multichain import, automatically calculate gains and losses, provide a visual interface for reviewing operations and allow export in multiple formats\n\n### Method 4: Specialized professional service\n\nFor users with complex operations or a high volume of transactions, a [professional portfolio analysis service](/servicios/analisis-carteras) offers maximum accuracy and peace of mind.\n\nThis type of service includes manual review of every transaction, correct tax classification according to AEAT-specific criteria, precise application of the FIFO method in line with Spanish regulations, generation of reports ready to be submitted to the Tax Agency, and specialized support in case of potential requests from the Tax Agency\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step guide: Complete export with Etherscan\n\nLet’s go through the detailed process to export your Metamask history using Etherscan, the most reliable method to obtain official blockchain data.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have your Metamask wallet address (it starts with 0x...), a list of all the networks where you have operated, stable internet access, a spreadsheet application such as Excel or Google Sheets to consolidate data, and enough storage space for multiple CSV files\n\n### Step 1: Identify your wallet address\n\n1. Open Metamask in your browser\n2. Click on your account name (above the balance)\n3. Your address will be copied automatically to the clipboard\n4. Save this address: you will use it in all explorers\n\n> **Note:** If you have multiple accounts in Metamask, you must export the history of each one separately.\n\n### Step 2: Export transactions from Ethereum (Etherscan)\n\n1. Go to [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io)\n2. Paste your address in the search bar\n3. You will see your wallet page with balance and transactions\n4. Scroll down to the transactions table\n5. Click on **\"Download CSV Export\"**\n6. Select the date range (ideally from your first transaction)\n7. Check **\"Txn Hash, Block, DateTime, From, To, Value\"**\n8. Download and save as `ETH_Transactions_2024.csv`\n\n**Important:** This basic export does not include:\n\n- Internal transactions (contract-to-contract calls)\n- ERC-20 token transfers\n- NFT operations (ERC-721, ERC-1155)\n\n### Step 3: Export ERC-20 tokens (Etherscan)\n\n1. On your Etherscan page, click on **\"Token Transfers (ERC-20)\"**\n2. You will see all token transfers\n3. Click on **\"Download CSV Export\"**\n4. Select the same date range\n5. Download and save as `ETH_ERC20_Transfers_2024.csv`\n\nThis file includes:\n\n- Tokens received (DEX purchases, airdrops, rewards)\n- Tokens sent (DEX sales, transfers)\n- Token information (name, symbol, amount)\n\n### Step 4: Export internal transactions\n\n1. On your Etherscan page, click on **\"Internal Txns\"**\n2. These are contract-to-contract calls involving your wallet\n3. Export as `ETH_Internal_Txns_2024.csv`\n\n**Why they are important:**\n\nInternal transactions include ETH received from contracts (rewards, staking withdrawals, swaps) that do not appear in the basic export.\n\n### Step 5: Repeat for other networks\n\nIf you have operated on Polygon, BSC or other networks, repeat steps 2–4 in each corresponding explorer:\n\n**Polygon (Polygonscan):**\n- URL: polygonscan.com\n- Files: `MATIC_Transactions.csv`, `MATIC_ERC20.csv`\n\n**BSC (BscScan):**\n- URL: bscscan.com\n- Files: `BSC_Transactions.csv`, `BSC_BEP20.csv`\n\n**Arbitrum (Arbiscan):**\n- URL: arbiscan.io\n- Files: `ARB_Transactions.csv`, `ARB_ERC20.csv`\n\n### Step 6: Verify data completeness\n\nBefore continuing, verify that you have exported from all networks where you have activity, that the date range covers from your first operation to the present, that the CSV files open correctly without format errors, and that the number of transactions roughly matches what is shown in each blockchain explorer\n\n---\n\n## How to interpret the exported CSV files\n\nOnce the files are downloaded, you need to understand their structure to process them correctly.\n\n### Structure of the transactions CSV (Etherscan)\n\n| Column | Description | Tax use |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Txhash** | Unique transaction hash | Verification and traceability |\n| **Blockno** | Block number | Chronological ordering |\n| **DateTime** | Date and time (UTC) | Determining tax year |\n| **From** | Source address | Identifying type of operation |\n| **To** | Destination address | Identifying type of operation |\n| **Value** | Amount of ETH | Gain calculation |\n| **Gas** | Gas used | Deduction of expenses |\n| **Gas Price** | Gas price (Gwei) | Fee calculation |\n| **TxnFee(ETH)** | Total fee in ETH | Deductible expense |\n\n### Identifying the type of operation\n\nTo classify each transaction for tax purposes, analyse the addresses:\n\n**If YOUR ADDRESS appears in \"From\":**\n- You sent ETH/tokens to another address\n- It may be: internal transfer, payment, swap (sale)\n\n**If YOUR ADDRESS appears in \"To\":**\n- You received ETH/tokens\n- It may be: own deposit, payment received, swap (purchase), airdrop\n\n**If the \"To\" address is a known contract:**\n- Uniswap router: DEX swap\n- Aave/Compound contract: Lending operation\n- Staking contract: Deposit or reward claim\n\n### Converting UTC dates to Spanish time\n\nEtherscan exports all dates in **UTC**. For Spain:\n\n- **Winter time:** UTC + 1 hour\n- **Summer time:** UTC + 2 hours\n\nThis is crucial for operations close to year-end.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- Transaction in Etherscan: 2024-12-31 23:30:00 UTC\n- Time in Spain (winter): 2025-01-01 00:30:00\n- **Tax year:** 2025 (not 2024)\n\n### Calculating gas fee in EUR\n\nTo calculate the real cost of gas as a deductible expense:\n\n1. **Gas Fee in ETH** = Gas × Gas Price / 1,000,000,000\n2. **Gas Fee in EUR** = Gas Fee in ETH × ETH/EUR price at that time\n\n**Example:**\n\n- Gas Used: 150,000\n- Gas Price: 30 Gwei\n- ETH price: €2,500\n- Gas Fee = 150,000 × 30 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.0045 ETH\n- Gas Fee EUR = 0.0045 × €2,500 = **€11.25**\n\n---\n\n## Common mistakes when exporting Metamask data (and how to avoid them)\n\n### Mistake 1: Exporting only the Ethereum mainnet\n\nMany users only export from Etherscan, forgetting they have also operated on Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum or other L2s. This leads to an incomplete tax history.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Check in Metamask all the networks you have configured\n- Check your address in the explorer of each network\n- Export from all networks where activity appears\n\n### Mistake 2: Not exporting ERC-20 token transfers\n\nThe basic Etherscan export only includes native ETH transactions. DEX swaps appear as ERC-20 token transfers that you must export separately.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Always export both \"Transactions\" and \"Token Transfers (ERC-20)\"\n- Also export \"Internal Txns\" for complete capture\n\n### Mistake 3: Not treating swaps as taxable exchanges\n\nSome users believe that exchanging ETH for USDC \"is not a sale\". Serious mistake: [every swap between cryptocurrencies is an exchange that generates taxation](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Identify all DEX swap operations\n- Calculate the gain/loss of each exchange\n- Declare all exchanges even if they are crypto-to-crypto\n\n### Mistake 4: Forgetting airdrops and rewards\n\nTokens received from airdrops, staking rewards or yield farming must be declared at their market price at the time of receipt.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Review the \"Token Transfers\" column looking for tokens received without consideration\n- Value each airdrop at the market price on the day of receipt\n- Declare them as investment income\n\n### Mistake 5: Not keeping transaction hashes\n\nThe transaction hash is the irrefutable proof of each operation on the blockchain. Without it, you cannot prove to the Tax Agency the details of your operations.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Keep the original CSVs with all txhash values\n- Save screenshots of important operations\n- Never delete the original files\n\n### Mistake 6: Not converting values to EUR\n\nThe Tax Agency requires all operations to be declared in euros, at the exchange rate on the exact day and time of each operation.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- For each operation, look up the EUR price of the cryptocurrency at that time\n- Reliable sources: CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, exchange data\n- Document the source of each historical quotation\n\n---\n\n## How to organize and process the exported data\n\nOnce you have all the CSV files, you need to consolidate and process them to create your tax report.\n\n### Recommended folder structure\n\n```\n📁 Metamask_Fiscal_2024/\n├── 📁 1_Original/\n│   ├── 📁 Ethereum/\n│   │   ├── 📄 ETH_Transactions_2024.csv\n│   │   ├── 📄 ETH_ERC20_Transfers_2024.csv\n│   │   └── 📄 ETH_Internal_Txns_2024.csv\n│   ├── 📁 Polygon/\n│   │   ├── 📄 MATIC_Transactions_2024.csv\n│   │   └── 📄 MATIC_ERC20_Transfers_2024.csv\n│   └── 📁 Arbitrum/\n│       └── ...\n├── 📁 2_Processed/\n│   ├── 📄 All_Consolidated_Transactions.xlsx\n│   ├── 📄 DEX_Swaps_with_EUR.xlsx\n│   └── 📄 DeFi_Yields.xlsx\n├── 📁 3_Evidence/\n│   ├── 📄 Etherscan_Screenshots.png\n│   ├── 📄 Historical_Prices.pdf\n│   └── 📄 Internal_Movements_Proof.pdf\n└── 📁 4_Final_Report/\n    └── 📄 Metamask_Tax_Summary_2024.xlsx\n```\n\n### Consolidation of operations\n\nTo create a complete tax report:\n\n**Step 1: Merge files by type**\n\n- Combine all transaction CSVs from different networks\n- Combine all ERC-20/BEP-20 token CSVs\n- Add a \"Network\" column to identify the source\n\n**Step 2: Remove duplicates**\n\n- Internal transactions may appear twice\n- Use the txhash as a unique identifier\n- Remove rows with duplicate txhash\n\n**Step 3: Classify by tax type**\n\n- Internal movement (non-taxable)\n- Exchange/swap (capital gain)\n- Receipt of yields (investment income)\n- Payment with crypto (capital gain)\n- Gas fees (deductible expense)\n\n**Step 4: Add EUR valuations**\n\n- For each operation, add columns with the EUR price\n- Calculate the total EUR value of each transaction\n- Sum gas fees converted to EUR\n\n### Calculating gains using the FIFO method\n\nSpain requires the FIFO method. To calculate it with Metamask data:\n\n**Simplified example:**\n\n**Operations:**\n1. 15/01/2024: You receive 1 ETH from Binance (purchased at €2,000)\n2. 20/02/2024: Swap 0.5 ETH → 1,200 USDC (ETH trades at €2,400)\n3. 15/03/2024: Swap 0.3 ETH → 900 DAI (ETH trades at €3,000)\n\n**FIFO calculation:**\n\n*Operation 2 (Swap ETH→USDC):*\n- Sale price: 0.5 × €2,400 = €1,200\n- Acquisition cost (FIFO): 0.5 × €2,000 = €1,000\n- **Capital gain:** €200\n\n*Operation 3 (Swap ETH→DAI):*\n- Sale price: 0.3 × €3,000 = €900\n- Acquisition cost (FIFO): 0.3 × €2,000 = €600\n- **Capital gain:** €300\n\n**Total capital gains:** €500\n\n**ETH remaining in portfolio:**\n- 0.2 ETH with an acquisition cost of €400 (0.2 × €2,000)\n\n### Tools to facilitate processing\n\nIf you have many operations, manual processing is complex. Some options:\n\n**Excel/Google Sheets:**\n- Import CSVs and use formulas to classify and calculate\n- Create pivot tables to summarize by type of operation\n- Use VLOOKUP (or XLOOKUP) to add historical quotations\n\n**Tax tools (Koinly, CoinTracking):**\n- Import wallet automatically\n- Manual review of misclassified operations\n- Report generation (requires adaptation to Spain)\n\n**Professional service:**\n- If your operations are complex (DeFi, multiple networks, high volume), a [tax settlement service](/servicios/liquidaciones-fiscales) guarantees accuracy and peace of mind\n\n---\n\n## Special cases and complex DeFi operations\n\n### Swaps on aggregators (1inch, Paraswap, Cowswap)\n\nDEX aggregators split operations into multiple transactions to get a better price. This can cause confusion in the records.\n\n**How to identify them:**\n\n- Multiple token transfers in the same block\n- Intermediate contract addresses\n- The final amount received may differ from the expected one (due to slippage)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Group all transactions from the same swap (same txhash or consecutive block)\n- Calculate the net value: tokens sent vs tokens received\n- Treat the set as a single taxable exchange\n\n### Providing liquidity in pools (Uniswap, Curve)\n\nWhen you deposit tokens in a liquidity pool:\n\n1. **Deposit:** You send tokens A and B, receive LP tokens\n2. **Period:** You accumulate fees proportional to your share\n3. **Withdrawal:** You return LP tokens, receive tokens A' and B' (amounts different from the deposit)\n\n**Tax treatment:**\n\n- The deposit of tokens → Not taxable (similar to a deposit)\n- Fees accumulated → Investment income\n- Withdrawal with impermanent loss → Capital gain/loss\n\nIf you need specialized help with complex DeFi operations, our [portfolio tracking service](/servicios/seguimiento-cartera) includes detailed analysis of positions in pools and protocols.\n\n### Bridging between networks\n\nWhen you move tokens between networks (Ethereum → Polygon, for example):\n\n**Tax treatment:**\n\n- If the token is the same (ETH on Ethereum → ETH on Polygon): **Non-taxable** (internal movement)\n- If there is a token conversion (ETH → WETH): technically it is an exchange, even if 1:1\n- Bridge fees are deductible expenses\n\n**Required documentation:**\n\n- Transaction hash on the source network\n- Transaction hash on the destination network\n- Proof that both addresses belong to you\n\n### Liquid staking (Lido, Rocket Pool)\n\nWhen you use liquid staking:\n\n1. You deposit ETH, receive stETH (or rETH)\n2. The stETH increases in value daily with rewards\n3. When you sell stETH, you realize the accumulated gain\n\n**Tax treatment:**\n\n- The ETH deposit → Not taxable\n- The increase in value of stETH → Realized when selling (capital gain)\n- Alternative: Declare daily rewards as investment income\n\n### Airdrops and reward claims\n\nAirdrops and rewards must be declared when you receive them:\n\n**Identification in CSVs:**\n\n- Token transfers where \"From\" is a contract and \"To\" is your wallet\n- No corresponding outgoing transaction (not a swap)\n- Significant amount of a new token\n\n**Valuation:**\n\n- Look up the token price at the exact time of the claim\n- If the token has no quotation, value at €0 (declare when you sell it)\n- Document the source of the quotation\n\n---\n\n## Preparing the final tax report\n\nOnce all the data have been processed, prepare a structured report for your tax return.\n\n### Recommended executive summary\n\n**1. General information:**\n\n- Tax period: 01/01/2024 - 31/12/2024\n- Wallets analysed: [your Metamask address]\n- Networks included: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum...\n- Total operations: XXX transactions\n\n**2.
