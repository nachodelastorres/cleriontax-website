  "excerpt": "Comprehensive guide to NFT taxation in Spain. Learn how to report your non-fungible tokens to the AEAT, the differences between creators and buyers, VAT, ITP, and capital gains.",
  "content": "**NFTs (non-fungible tokens)** have revolutionized the world of digital art, collectibles, and digital ownership. However, their tax treatment in Spain has important nuances that every investor, collector, or creator should know.\n\nUnlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are considered **unique movable property** for tax purposes, which leads to significant differences in how they are taxed by the AEAT.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide we’ll analyze how NFTs are taxed in Spain in 2025, what your tax obligations are depending on your activity, and how to avoid costly mistakes.\n\n---\n\n## What NFTs are and why their taxation is different\n\n**NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** are unique, non-repeatable digital assets that represent ownership of a digital or physical good via blockchain technology.\n\n### Distinctive characteristics of NFTs\n\nUnlike fungible cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin or USDT, where each unit is identical and interchangeable), NFTs have specific characteristics:\n\n- ✅ **Uniqueness:** Each NFT is unique and cannot be replicated\n- ✅ **Indivisibility:** They cannot be split (you can’t hold 0.5 NFTs)\n- ✅ **Verifiability:** Their authenticity and ownership are verified on-chain\n- ✅ **Transferability:** They can be bought, sold, or transferred\n\n### Tax treatment: NFTs as movable property\n\nThe AEAT treats NFTs as **movable property** for tax purposes, similar to:\n\n- Physical works of art\n- Jewelry and antiques\n- Collectibles\n- Vehicles\n\nThis classification means their taxation follows the same rules as these traditional assets, with the particularities of digital assets.\n\n> **Key difference:** While fungible cryptocurrencies are mainly taxed as capital gains in the **savings base**, NFTs may be taxed either in the savings base (buyers/investors) or in the **general base** (professional creators).\n\n---\n\n## Taxation for NFT buyers and investors\n\nIf you buy NFTs as an investment, for collecting, or to resell later, your activity is considered **personal wealth management**, not an economic activity.\n\n### Personal income tax (IRPF): Capital gains\n\nWhen you sell an NFT you previously purchased, you realize a **capital gain or loss** that is included in the **savings tax base** of the IRPF.\n\n#### Calculating the gain or loss\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nGain/Loss = Disposal value − Acquisition value − Expenses\n```\n\n**Where:**\n- **Disposal value:** Sale price of the NFT (in euros)\n- **Acquisition value:** Price you paid when buying it (including the price in ETH or other crypto converted to euros at the exchange rate on the day)\n- **Deductible expenses:** Gas fees, marketplace commissions, minting costs if you bore them as the buyer\n\n#### Applicable tax rates (2025)\n\nCapital gains on NFTs are taxed at these brackets:\n\n| Capital gain | Tax rate |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Up to €6,000 | 19% |\n| €6,000 to €50,000 | 21% |\n| €50,000 to €200,000 | 23% |\n| €200,000 to €300,000 | 27% |\n| Over €300,000 | 28% |\n\n### Practical example: Buying and selling an NFT\n\n**Case:** María buys a digital art NFT on OpenSea:\n\n**Purchase (March 15, 2024):**\n- Price: 2 ETH\n- ETH rate: €2,500/ETH → **€5,000**\n- Gas fees: 0.05 ETH → **€125**\n- **Total acquisition cost: €5,125**\n\n**Sale (October 20, 2024):**\n- Price: 3 ETH\n- ETH rate: €2,800/ETH → **€8,400**\n- OpenSea fee (2.5%): **€210**\n- Gas fees: 0.04 ETH → **€112**\n- **Net disposal value: €8,078**\n\n**Tax result:**\n```\nCapital gain = €8,078 − €5,125 = €2,953\nTax (19%): €561.07\n```\n\nMaría will report this gain in her 2024 income tax return (Form 100, **box 389**).\n\n### Reporting in Form 100\n\nGains from NFT sales are reported in:\n\n- **Box 389:** Other capital gains to be included in the savings base\n- **Identification annex:** NFT description, purchase/sale dates, amounts\n\n**Recommended documentation to keep:**\n- Screenshot of the on-chain transaction (Etherscan, Polygonscan, etc.)\n- Marketplace buy/sell confirmations\n- Price history (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko)\n- Invoices for gas fees and commissions\n\n### Offsetting capital losses\n\nIf you sell NFTs at a loss, these can be offset against:\n\n- ✅ Capital gains in the same year (other NFTs, crypto, shares)\n- ✅ Investment income (up to 25%)\n- ✅ Loss carryforwards from prior years (up to 4 years)\n\nThis helps optimize your tax burden if your NFT portfolio has mixed results (gains and losses).\n\n---\n\n## Taxation for NFT creators and artists\n\nIf you create and sell your own NFTs (digital art, music, photography, generative collections), your activity is treated as **income from an economic activity**, not a capital gain.\n\n### Taxation as a professional economic activity\n\nNFT creators must register as **self-employed (autónomos)** with the Tax Agency and Social Security.\n\n#### Obligations for professional creators\n\n1. **Register in the Business Census (Form 036/037)**\n   - IAE heading: **8493** – “Services related to information technology and computing”\n   - Alternative: **759.9** – “Other professional services n.e.c.”\n\n2. **Register in the Self-Employed Regime (RETA)**\n   - Monthly contribution based on chosen contribution base\n   - Flat rate available for new self-employed (**€80/month** for the first 12 months in 2025)\n\n3. **Quarterly VAT return (Form 303)**\n   - Standard rate: **21%** on the sale price\n   - Option for simplified scheme depending on turnover\n\n4. **IRPF advance payments (Form 130)**\n   - **20%** on quarterly profits\n   - Quarterly filing (April, July, October, January)\n\n### Income in the IRPF general base\n\nIncome from selling NFTs you created is taxed in the **general base** of the IRPF, with higher progressive rates:\n\n| Net income | State rate | Regional rate (approx.) | **Approx. total** |\n|------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| Up to €12,450 | 9.5% | 9% | **18.5%** |\n| €12,450 to €20,200 | 12% | 12% | **24%** |\n| €20,200 to €35,200 | 15% | 15% | **30%** |\n| €35,200 to €60,000 | 18.5% | 18.5% | **37%** |\n| €60,000 to €300,000 | 22.5% | 21.5% | **44%** |\n| Over €300,000 | 24.5% | 22.5% | **47%** |\n\n> **Note:** Regional percentages vary by autonomous community. Total rates are indicative.\n\n### Deductible expenses for creators\n\nAs a business activity, you can deduct all directly related expenses:\n\n- ✅ **Hardware and software:** Computers, graphic tablets, Adobe licenses, Blender, Procreate, etc.\n- ✅ **Minting gas fees:** Costs to publish the NFT on-chain\n- ✅ **Marketplace commissions:** Listing fees on OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, etc.\n- ✅ **Promotion costs:** Social ads, collaborations, marketing campaigns\n- ✅ **Professional services:** Designers, developers, tax advisors\n- ✅ **Training:** Courses on digital art, blockchain, NFT marketing\n- ✅ **Home office utilities:** Proportion of electricity, internet, rent if working from home\n- ✅ **Financing costs:** Interest on loans to fund the activity\n\n### Practical example: Professional creator\n\n**Case:** Albert is a digital artist creating NFT collections:\n\n**2024 income:**\n- Sale of 50 NFTs: **€45,000**\n- Secondary royalties (2.5% resale): **€3,000**\n- **Total income: €48,000**\n\n**Deductible expenses:**\n- Equipment (iPad Pro, software): **€3,500**\n- Gas fees and marketplace commissions: **€4,200**\n- Advertising and marketing: **€2,800**\n- Tax and accounting advisory: **€1,200**\n- Utilities (30% of home): **€1,800**\n- Training and courses: **€800**\n- **Total expenses: €14,300**\n\n**Tax result:**\n```\nNet income = €48,000 − €14,300 = €33,700\n\nIRPF (avg. rate ~30%): €10,110\nSocial Security contributions: €4,800\nTotal tax burden: €14,910\n```\n\nAdditionally, Albert must manage quarterly VAT (output and input VAT).\n\n---\n\n## VAT on NFT transactions\n\n**VAT (Value Added Tax)** treatment for NFT transactions depends on who the seller is and where the parties are resident.\n\n### Sales by a professional or company (B2C / B2B)\n\nIf the seller is a **self-employed person or company** selling NFTs:\n\n- ✅ **Charge 21% VAT** on the sale price\n- ✅ The buyer pays price + VAT\n- ✅ The seller files quarterly returns (Form 303)\n\n**Example:**\n- NFT price: **€1,000**\n- VAT (21%): **€210**\n- **Total paid by buyer: €1,210**\n\n### Sales between private individuals (C2C)\n\nIf the seller is a **private individual** (non-professional), the transaction is subject to the **Transfer Tax (ITP)**, not VAT.\n\n- ✅ The **buyer** must pay the ITP\n- ✅ Rate: varies by autonomous community (generally **4%–10%**)\n- ✅ Filing deadline: **30 business days** from purchase\n\n**Example in Madrid (6% ITP):**\n- NFT price: **€5,000**\n- ITP (6%): **€300**\n- The buyer must file the self-assessment ITP form with the regional authority\n\n### Cross-border transactions\n\nWhen buyer and seller reside in different countries:\n\n| Operation type | VAT treatment |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| **Spanish seller → EU buyer (consumer)** | Spanish VAT 21% |\n| **Spanish seller → EU buyer (business)** | Reverse charge (no Spanish VAT) |\n| **Spanish seller → Non-EU buyer** | VAT-exempt (export) |\n| **Foreign seller → Spanish buyer (business)** | Spanish VAT self-assessment |\n\n> **Important:** The tax location of marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible or Foundation may affect VAT application. Consult a tax advisor for complex cases.\n\n---\n\n## Transfer Tax (ITP) and NFTs\n\nWhen a **private individual** sells an NFT to another private individual, the transaction is subject to **ITP**, a regionally administered tax.\n\n### Buyer’s obligations\n\nThe buyer must:\n\n1. **File the ITP self-assessment** with their autonomous community of residence\n2. **Deadline:** 30 business days from the purchase date\n3. **Documentation:** Sale contract, proof of payment, blockchain screenshot\n\n### Regional ITP rates for movable property (2025)\n\n| Region | ITP rate on movables |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Madrid** | 6% |\n| **Catalonia** | 10% |\n| **Andalusia** | 8% |\n| **Valencian Community** | 10% |\n| **Basque Country** | 4% |\n| **Galicia** | 10% |\n\n> **Note:** These rates may change. Check your region’s specific rules.\n\n### Practical example: ITP on private sale\n\n**Case:** Llúcia (private individual) buys a CryptoPunk NFT from Javier (private individual):\n\n- Agreed price: **€80,000**\n- Region: **Madrid (6% ITP)**\n- **ITP due: €4,800**\n\nLlúcia must file the ITP self-assessment in the Community of Madrid within 30 days of purchase and keep all documentation evidencing the transaction.\n\n---\n\n## Reporting NFTs in Form 100 (IRPF)\n\nRegardless of your profile (buyer, investor or creator), you must include your NFT transactions in the **annual income tax return**.\n\n### For buyers/investors (capital gains)\n\n**Section:** Savings tax base\n\n**Main boxes:**\n\n- **Box 389:** Other capital gains to include in the savings base\n- **Box 390:** Capital losses to include in the savings base\n\n**Information to include:**\n- NFT description (name, collection, identifier)\n- Acquisition date\n- Acquisition value (in euros)\n- Disposal date\n- Disposal value (in euros)\n- Related expenses (gas fees, commissions)\n\n### For professional creators (business income)\n\n**Section:** General tax base – Income from economic activities\n\n**Main boxes:**\n\n- **Boxes 086 to 094:** Income from economic activities under direct assessment\n- Total annual income\n- Deductible expenses by category\n- Net income\n\n**Recommended supporting documents:**\n- Income and expense ledger\n- Invoices issued and received\n- Proof of advance payments (Form 130)\n- VAT returns (Form 303)\n\n### NFTs held (not sold)\n\nIf you hold NFTs **without selling them**, there’s no IRPF tax that year. However:\n\n- ✅ They may count for the **Wealth Tax** (Form 714) if your total net worth exceeds your region’s exemption threshold\n- ✅ They must be valued at their **acquisition price**\n- ✅ If held on foreign exchanges or wallets and exceed **€50,000**, they may be reportable on **Form 721** (foreign crypto assets return)\n\n---\n\n## NFT royalties: special tax treatment\n\nMany NFTs include **automatic royalties** that generate recurring income each time the NFT is resold on the secondary market.\n\n### Taxation of royalties for the creator\n\nRoyalties received by the original creator are treated as:\n\n- ✅ **Business income** if you are a professional creator (self-employed)\n- ✅ **Investment income** if you are an occasional creator (non-professional)\n\n#### Professional creator (self-employed)\n\n- Taxed in the **general base** of the IRPF\n- Subject to **21% VAT**\n- **15% withholding** required if the marketplace is Spanish\n- Quarterly filings (Forms 130 and 303)\n\n#### Occasional creator (individual)\n\n- Taxed in the **general base** of the IRPF as investment income\n- Not subject to VAT\n- Progressive rates depending on total income\n- Annual filing in Form 100\n\n### Royalties example\n\n**Case:** Carlos created a collection of 1,000 NFTs with a 5% royalty on each resale:\n\n**Year 2024:**\n- Secondary market resale volume: **€200,000**\n- Royalties received (5%): **€10,000**\n\n**Taxation (professional self-employed creator):**\n- Output VAT (21%): **€2,100**\n- IRPF on net income: **~€3,000** (depending on marginal rate)\n- Total tax burden: **~€5,100**\n\nCarlos must include this €10,000 in his business income and manage the corresponding VAT.\n\n---\n\n## Tax differences between NFTs and cryptocurrencies\n\nAlthough both are blockchain-based digital assets, their tax treatment differs significantly:\n\n| Aspect | Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) | NFTs |\n|--------|------------------------------|------|\n| **Tax classification** | Financial assets | Movable property |\n| **Fungibility** | Fungible (interchangeable) | Non-fungible (unique) |\n| **Buyer taxation** | Capital gain (savings base) | Capital gain (savings base) |\n| **Creator taxation** | Not applicable (you don’t “create” BTC) | Economic activity (general base) |\n| **VAT on professional sale** | Exempt | Subject to 21% |\n| **ITP between individuals** | Generally not applicable | Yes, 4%–10% |\n| **Acquisition value method** | FIFO, average price, identification | Specific identification (unique) |\n| **Royalties** | Not applicable | Applicable (smart contracts) |\n\nThese differences make NFT tax management more complex and require an individualized treatment of each asset.\n\n---\n\n## Common mistakes when reporting NFTs (and how to avoid them)\n\nNFT taxation is recent and complex, leading to frequent mistakes that can result in penalties.\n\n### Mistake 1: Not reporting NFT sales\n\n**Issue:** Assuming blockchain transactions are “anonymous” or “undetectable.”\n\n**Reality:** The AEAT can trace transactions via:\n- Public blockchain analytics\n- Information from exchanges and marketplaces\n- Cross-checks with bank accounts and credit cards\n\n**Solution:** Report all your transactions, regardless of amount.\n\n### Mistake 2: Confusing capital gains with gross proceeds\n\n**Issue:** Reporting the sale price as the gain without subtracting the acquisition cost.\n\n**Incorrect example:**\n- NFT sale: **€10,000**\n- Wrongly reported gain: **€10,000**\n\n**Correct example:**\n- NFT sale: **€10,000**\n- Acquisition cost: **€6,000**\n- **Actual gain: €4,000**\n\n**Solution:** Correctly calculate the capital gain or loss.\n\n### Mistake 3: Not converting to euros on the date of each transaction\n\n**Issue:** Using today’s exchange rate instead of the historical one.\n\n**Correct approach:** Each transaction (buy/sell) must be valued in euros at the **exchange rate on the transaction date**.\n\n**Solution:** Keep records of:\n- Exact date of each transaction\n- ETH/EUR or crypto/EUR rate for that day\n- Source (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Kraken, etc.)\n\n### Mistake 4: Ignoring ITP on private purchases\n\n**Issue:** Failing to file the ITP self-assessment after buying an NFT from another individual.\n\n**Consequence:** Penalty for late filing or non-filing.\n\n**Solution:** File the ITP within 30 days of purchase in your region.\n\n### Mistake 5: Creators not registering as self-employed\n\n**Issue:** Selling NFTs on a recurring basis without registering with Tax Authorities and Social Security.\n\n**Consequence:**\n- Penalties for not issuing VAT invoices\n- Retroactive settlement of self-employment contributions\n- Penalties for not filing quarterly returns\n\n**Solution:** If you regularly create and sell NFTs, register as self-employed from the first sale.\n\n---\n\n## How to properly prepare your NFT tax return\n\nPreparing an accurate tax return for your NFT transactions requires organization, documentation, and technical knowledge.\n\n### Required documentation\n\nCollect and keep:\n\n- ✅ **Transaction hashes:** Unique on-chain identifiers (Etherscan, Polygonscan)\n- ✅ **Screenshots:** Marketplace buy/sell confirmations\n- ✅ **Price history:** ETH or other crypto quotes on operation dates\n- ✅ **Invoices and receipts:** Gas fees, commissions, minting costs\n- ✅ **Contracts:** Purchase agreements if any\n- ✅ **NFT metadata:** Name, collection, smart contract\n\n### Useful tracking tools\n\n1. **Blockchain explorers:**\n   - Etherscan (Ethereum)\n   - Polygonscan (Polygon)\n   - BscScan (Binance Smart Chain)\n   - Solscan (Solana)\n\n2. **Portfolio trackers:**\n   - Nansen\n   - DeBank\n   - Zerion\n   - Rainbow\n\n3. **Specialized tax software:**\n   - Koinly\n   - CryptoTax\n   - Accointing\n   - TokenTax\n\n### Recommended process\n\n**Step 1:** Export all your transactions from each marketplace (OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, etc.)\n\n**Step 2:** Identify each operation:\n- Purchases (acquisitions)\n- Sales (disposals)\n- Transfers\n- Minting (creation)\n\n**Step 3:** Value each operation in euros at the rate on the day\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate gains/losses for each sale\n\n**Step 5:** Group by type of income:\n- Capital gains (investors)\n- Business income (creators)\n\n**Step 6:** Complete Form 100 with the processed information\n\n---\n\n## Special regime: Wealth Tax\n\nIf your total net worth exceeds your region’s exemption threshold, you must include your NFTs in the **Wealth Tax return (Form 714)**.\n\n### When does it apply?\n\nGenerally when your net worth exceeds:\n- **€700,000** (state-level exemption)\n- Each autonomous community may set its own threshold or reliefs\n\n### Valuing NFTs for Wealth Tax\n\nNFTs must be valued at:\n\n1. **Acquisition price** if you still hold them\n2. **Market value** if there is an active, verifiable market\n3. **Valuation/appraisal** for unique, high-value NFTs\n\n### Example\n\n**Case:** Robert has total net worth of **€950,000**:\n\n- Main residence: **€400,000** (exempt up to **€300,000**)\n- Bank accounts: **€150,000**\n- Shares: **€200,000**\n- NFTs: **€100,000**\n- Cryptocurrencies: **€100,000**\n\n**Wealth Tax base:**\n```\n€950,000 − €300,000 (home exemption) − €700,000 (general exemption) = €0\n```\n\nIn this case, Robert would not pay Wealth Tax, but he would still need to file **Form 714** for information purposes if required by his region.\n\nIf net worth were higher, NFTs would count toward the taxable base.\n\n---\n\n## Informative obligations: Form 721\n\nIf you hold NFTs in foreign wallets or international marketplaces and their value exceeds **€50,000** on December 31, you may be required to file **Form 721** (foreign crypto assets report).\n\n### Are NFTs subject to Form 721?\n\nYes, NFTs are considered **crypto assets** for Form 721 if:\n\n- ✅ Held in personal wallets (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)\n- ✅ Held on international marketplaces without a Spanish entity\n- ✅ Their combined value exceeds **€50,000** on December 31\n\n### Information to report\n\nFor each NFT or group of NFTs:\n\n- Asset description\n- Wallet address where it is held\n- Blockchain used\n- Value in euros on December 31\n- Marketplace or protocol (if applicable)\n\n### Filing deadline\n\n**March** of the year following the tax year.\n\n> **Important:** Not filing Form 721 when required can lead to penalties from **€1,500** up to **150%** of the unreported value.\n\n---\n\n## Special cases: airdrops, free drops and gifts\n\nSome NFT projects distribute tokens for free (**airdrops**) or allow free minting (**free mints**).\n\n### Taxation of NFTs received for free\n\n**At receipt:**\n- No immediate taxation if there is no consideration\n- The tax acquisition value is **€0**\n\n**At sale:**\n- The capital gain is **100% of the sale price** (minus expenses)\n- Taxed as a capital gain in the savings base\n\n### Example: NFT airdrop\n\n**Case:** Ana receives a free NFT from a project she participates in.\n\n**At receipt:**\n- Tax acquisition value: **€0**\n- Taxation: none\n\n**Later sale (6 months later):**\n- Sale price: **€2,000**\n- Gas fees: **€50**\n- **Capital gain: €1,950**\n- Tax (19%): **€370.50**\n\n### NFTs received as a gift or donation\n\n**For the donor:**\n- No IRPF taxation (gratuitous transfer)\n\n**For the recipient:**\n- Subject to **Inheritance and Gift Tax**\n- Rate depends on region and relationship\n- Valuation: market value at the time of the gift\n\n---\n\n## The future of NFT taxation in Spain\n\nNFT tax regulation is evolving. Expected trends include:\n\n### Specific rules under development\n\n- ✅ EU **MiCA** (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, which may extend to NFTs\n- ✅ Possible creation of specific forms for digital assets\n- ✅ Greater clarity on distinctions between investment, collectible and utility NFTs\n\n### Increased oversight and enforcement\n\n- ✅ Marketplaces required to report transactions (**DAC8** directive)\n- ✅ Automatic cross-matching of blockchain and tax information\n- ✅ More specific penalties for NFT non-compliance\n\n### Future tax opportunities\n\n- Possible VAT reduction for digital art (like traditional art)\n- Tax incentives for digital creators\n- Clarification of **utility NFT** treatment (access, memberships)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: transparency and professional advice\n\nNFT taxation in Spain has **complex particularities** requiring specialized attention:\n\n### Key takeaways\n\n- ✅ **NFTs as movable property:** Different taxation than fungible cryptocurrencies\n- ✅ **Buyers/investors:** Capital gains in the savings base (19%–28%)\n- ✅ **Professional creators:** Economic activity in the general base (up to 47%) + VAT\n- ✅ **ITP between individuals:** 4%–10% depending on region\n- ✅ **Form 721:** Mandatory if you exceed **€50,000** abroad\n- ✅ **Documentation:** Essential to keep evidence of all transactions\n\n### Final recommendations\n\n1. **Keep detailed records** of all transactions from day one\n2. **Convert to euros** on the date of each transaction\n3. **Keep evidence** of on-chain records, price quotes, and expenses\n4. **Consult an expert** before high-value operations\n5. **Always file:** The blockchain is public and traceable\n\n---\n\n## Cleriontax: experts in NFT and crypto asset taxation\n\nDo you hold NFTs and need help meeting your tax obligations?
