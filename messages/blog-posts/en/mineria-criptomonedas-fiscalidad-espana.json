  "excerpt": "Comprehensive guide to cryptocurrency mining taxation in Spain. Learn how to register as self-employed, your obligations with the AEAT, Modelo 130, allowable deductions, and the differences between professional and occasional miners.",
  "content": "**Cryptocurrency mining** has evolved from an activity accessible to enthusiasts into a **professional industry** that requires significant investment in hardware, electricity, and technical know-how.\n\nBeyond the technological aspects, mining Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies has very specific tax implications in Spain that every miner should understand.\n\nUnlike the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies—which is taxed as a capital gain—**mining is considered an economic activity** by the AEAT, which entails more complex tax obligations: IAE registration, self-employment (RETA) contributions, VAT, quarterly advance payments, and taxation in the IRPF general base.\n\nIn this complete guide we analyze every tax aspect of cryptocurrency mining in Spain in 2025, from the moment you start mining to the annual filing of your income.\n\n\n## What cryptocurrency mining is and why it is an economic activity\n\n\n\n### Concept of mining\n\n**Cryptocurrency mining** is the process by which transactions are validated on blockchain networks using computing power, in exchange for rewards in the form of newly issued cryptocurrencies and transaction fees.\n\n### Main types of mining\n\n**1. Proof of Work (PoW) – Traditional mining:**\n- Bitcoin (BTC)\n- Litecoin (LTC)\n- Dogecoin (DOGE)\n- Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n- Monero (XMR)\n\nRequires specialized hardware (ASICs or powerful GPUs) and consumes large amounts of electricity.\n\n**2. Pool Mining (group mining):**\n\nInstead of solo mining, miners join pools where they share computing power and split rewards proportionally.\n\nMajor pools:\n- Foundry USA Pool\n- AntPool\n- F2Pool\n- Binance Pool\n- Slush Pool\n\n**3. Cloud Mining:**\n\nRenting mining power from specialized companies without owning hardware. Less profitable but with lower technical complexity.\n\n\n### AEAT’s position: mining as an economic activity\n\nAccording to the **Dirección General de Tributos** (binding rulings V2846-18 and V0999-18), cryptocurrency mining is considered an **economic activity** when it is carried out:\n\n- ✅ **Habitually:** On an ongoing basis over time\n- ✅ **In an organized manner:** With your own production means (hardware, facilities)\n- ✅ **For profit:** With the aim of obtaining economic returns\n\nThis means that mining income is **business income from an economic activity**, not capital gains.\n\n> **Key difference:** If you buy Bitcoin, it is taxed as a capital gain (savings base). If you mine Bitcoin, it is taxed as an economic activity (general base with higher rates).\n\n\n## Professional miner vs. occasional miner: tax differences\n\nNot all mining activity receives the same tax treatment. The AEAT distinguishes between professional and occasional mining.\n\n### Professional miner (economic activity)\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Continuous, habitual mining\n- Significant investment in equipment\n- Dedicated facilities (mining farm)\n- High and constant electricity consumption\n- Participation in professional mining pools\n\n**Tax obligations:**\n- ✅ Registration in the IAE (Impuesto sobre Actividades Económicas – Economic Activities Tax)\n- ✅ Enrollment in RETA (Régimen Especial de Trabajadores Autónomos – Self-Employed Scheme)\n- ✅ Quarterly VAT returns (Modelo 303) – **NOT SUBJECT**\n- ✅ IRPF advance payments (Modelo 130)\n- ✅ Annual return in Modelo 100 (general base)\n- ✅ Income and expense ledgers\n\n### Occasional miner (individual)\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Sporadic or experimental mining\n- Home equipment (personal PC, gaming GPU)\n- No dedicated facilities\n- Secondary activity without professional profit motive\n\n**Tax obligations:**\n- ✅ No need to register as self-employed\n- ✅ Mined cryptocurrencies are valued at **€0** upon receipt\n- ✅ Taxation only upon sale (capital gain in the savings base)\n- ✅ Report in Modelo 100 if sold\n\n### When are you required to register as self-employed?\n\n**Guiding criteria:**\n\n| Indicator | Occasional miner | Professional miner |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Equipment** | 1–2 home GPUs | Multiple ASICs or a GPU farm |\n| **Initial investment** | < €3,000 | > €5,000 |\n| **Monthly electricity use** | < 300 kWh extra | > 500 kWh dedicated |\n| **Estimated monthly income** | < €300 | > €500 |\n| **Continuity** | Intermittent | Continuous (24/7) |\n| **Facilities** | Personal home | Dedicated premises/warehouse |\n\nIf you meet several “professional miner” criteria, you should register as self-employed.\n\n\n## How to register as a self-employed cryptocurrency miner\n\n\n\n### Step 1: Census registration (Modelo 036 or 037)\n\nYou must register in the **Business Census** using Modelo 036 (full) or 037 (simplified).\n\n### Main fields to complete\n\n**IAE heading:**\n\nCryptocurrency mining can be classified under:\n\n- **Option 1 (recommended): Heading 831.9** – “Other financial services n.e.c.”\n- **Option 2: Heading 849.9** – “Other information technology-related services”\n\n> **Tip:** Check with your tax advisor which is most appropriate for your specific activity and region.\n\n**VAT regime:**\n\nTick **operations NOT subject to VAT** for mining activity (explained below).\n\n**Economic activity description:**\n\nDescription: “Cryptocurrency mining using blockchain technology”\n\n### Filing deadline\n\nFile Modelo 036/037 **before starting** the activity or, at the latest, in the month you begin operating.\n\n**Where to file?**\n\n- Online: AEAT e-office (requires digital certificate or Cl@ve PIN)\n- In person: Tax Agency office with an appointment\n\n\n### Step 2: Enroll in the Self-Employed Scheme (RETA)\n\nAt the same time as your census registration, you must enroll in **RETA** (Self-Employed Social Security Scheme).\n\n### Self-employed contributions in 2025\n\nSince 2023, Spain applies a **real income-based contribution system** with brackets:\n\n| Monthly net income | Indicative monthly contribution |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Under €670 | €230 |\n| €670–€900 | €260 |\n| €900–€1,166 | €275 |\n| €1,166–€1,300 | €291 |\n| €1,300–€1,500 | €294 |\n| €1,500–€1,700 | €294 |\n| €1,700–€1,850 | €310 |\n| €1,850–€2,030 | €315 |\n| €2,030–€2,330 | €337 |\n| €2,330–€2,760 | €360 |\n| €2,760–€3,190 | €382 |\n| €3,190–€3,620 | €404 |\n| €3,620–€4,050 | €426 |\n| Over €6,000 | €530 |\n\n**Flat rate for new self-employed:**\n\nIf this is your first time as self-employed (or more than 2 years have passed since your last registration):\n\n- **First 12 months:** €80/month (≈80% reduction)\n- **Following 12 months:** Progressive reductions\n\n### RETA enrollment process\n\n**Deadline:** Within **30 calendar days** from the start of activity.\n\n**Channels:**\n- Online: Social Security e-office (Import@ss)\n- In person: Social Security office\n\n**Required documents:**\n- DNI/NIE\n- Form TA.0521 (enrollment request)\n- Proof of census registration (Modelo 036)\n\n\n## IRPF taxation: income from an economic activity\n\n\n\n### Inclusion in the IRPF general base\n\nIncome from cryptocurrency mining is taxed in the **IRPF general base**, with progressive rates significantly higher than the savings base.\n\n### 2025 tax rates (state + regional)\n\n| Income bracket | State rate | Approx. regional rate | **Indicative total** |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| Up to €12,450 | 9.5% | 9% | **18.5%** |\n| €12,450–€20,200 | 12% | 12% | **24%** |\n| €20,200–€35,200 | 15% | 15% | **30%** |\n| €35,200–€60,000 | 18.5% | 18.5% | **37%** |\n| €60,000–€300,000 | 22.5% | 21.5% | **44%** |\n| Over €300,000 | 24.5% | 22.5% | **47%** |\n\n> **Note:** Regional rates vary by autonomous community. Totals are indicative.\n\n**Comparison with savings base (crypto trading):**\n\n| Savings base | Tax rate |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Up to €6,000 | 19% |\n| €6,000–€50,000 | 21% |\n| €50,000–€200,000 | 23% |\n| Over €200,000 | 28% |\n\nAs you can see, **taxation as an economic activity is higher**, especially for middle-to-upper incomes.\n\n\n### Calculating net income\n\nNet income from mining is calculated as:\n\n```\nNet income = Total income − Deductible expenses\n```\n\n### Valuing income\n\nIncome is determined by the **market value** of the cryptocurrencies mined at the time you receive them.\n\n**Example:**\n\nYou mine 0.5 BTC on March 15, 2024:\n- BTC price that day: €55,000/BTC\n- **Income to report: €27,500**\n\nThat amount (€27,500) will also be your **tax acquisition value** when you sell those BTC in the future.\n\n### Valuation frequency\n\n**Option 1 (recommended):** Value each reward individually when received\n\n**Option 2:** Aggregate valuation (e.g., monthly), computing the monthly average value\n\n> **Tip:** Use tracking tools like Koinly or CryptoTax that automatically record each mining reward with its exact quote.\n\n\n## VAT on cryptocurrency mining: NOT subject to VAT\n\nOne tax advantage of mining is that it is **NOT subject to VAT**, according to the AEAT’s criteria.\n\n### Why is there no VAT on mining?\n\nUnder Spain’s VAT Law (Law 37/1992), for a transaction to be subject to VAT it must:\n\n1. Be a supply of goods or a provision of services\n2. Have a **direct link** between the service and the consideration\n3. Clearly identify supplier and recipient\n\nIn cryptocurrency mining:\n\n- ❌ There is no specific recipient of the service\n- ❌ There is no direct link between the validation work and a specific reward\n- ❌ The reward comes from the blockchain protocol, not from a client\n\nTherefore, **the activity is NOT subject to VAT**.\n\n### Practical consequences\n\n**Advantages:**\n- ✅ You do not charge VAT (21%) on your mining income\n- ✅ Administrative simplification\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- ❌ You cannot deduct input VAT on purchases related to the activity (electricity, equipment, etc.)\n\n### VAT returns (Modelo 303)\n\nEven though mining is not subject to VAT, you must:\n\n- File quarterly VAT returns marking the box for **non-subject operations**\n- If you only carry out mining, your returns will be “blank” (no quotas)\n- Keep evidence supporting that your activity is non-subject\n\n### Subsequent sale of mined cryptocurrencies\n\nWhen you sell the cryptocurrencies you mined:\n\n- If you sell to **individuals (P2P):** No VAT\n- If you sell via **exchanges:** No VAT (exempt operations)\n- The gain/loss compared to the acquisition value (value when mined) is taxed as a capital gain\n\n\n## Deductible expenses in mining activity\n\nAs an economic activity, you may deduct all expenses **directly related** to mining.\n\n### Main deductible expenses\n\n#### 1. Electricity (energy consumption)\n\n**The most important expense for miners.**\n\n- ✅ 100% deductible if you have a separate meter for mining equipment\n- ✅ Deductible proportionally if it’s a mixed meter (home + mining)\n\n**Calculating the deductible percentage:**\n\n```\n% Deductible = (Mining equipment consumption / Total consumption) × 100\n```\n\n**Example:**\n- Total monthly home consumption: 400 kWh\n- Estimated mining equipment consumption: 300 kWh\n- Deductible percentage: 75%\n- Monthly electricity bill: €150\n- **Deductible expense: €112.50**\n\n#### 2. Mining hardware\n\n**Specific equipment:**\n- ASIC miners (Antminer, Whatsminer, etc.)\n- High-performance GPUs\n- Power supplies\n- Cooling systems (fans, air conditioning)\n- Racks and shelving\n\n**Tax treatment:**\n- If the cost is **< €300:** Directly deductible expense\n- If the cost is **> €300:** Depreciation per official tables\n\n**Depreciation table:**\n\n| Asset | Max. coefficient | Max. period | Estimated useful life |\n|-------|------------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| IT equipment | 25% | 8 years | 4–5 years |\n| Technical installations | 10% | 20 years | 10 years |\n\n**Depreciation example:**\n\nYou purchase an Antminer S19 Pro for €5,000:\n- Annual depreciation: €5,000 × 25% = **€1,250/year**\n- You can deduct €1,250 per year for 4 years\n\n#### 3. Dedicated premises or space\n\n**If you mine from home (primary residence):**\n- Deductible proportionally according to m² used exclusively\n- Maximum: 30% of expenses (AEAT commonly accepts 20–30%)\n\n**Deductible premises expenses:**\n- Rent or depreciation (if owned)\n- Property tax (IBI)\n- Homeowners’ association fees\n- Home insurance (proportionally)\n- Repairs and maintenance\n\n**Example:**\n\n100 m² home, 15 m² room dedicated to mining:\n- Percentage: 15%\n- Monthly rent: €800\n- **Deductible monthly expense: €120**\n\n#### 4. Connectivity and communications\n\n- ✅ Internet (100% if exclusive, proportional if shared)\n- ✅ Business mobile phone\n- ✅ Servers and hosting (for pools or own nodes)\n\n#### 5. Software and subscriptions\n\n- ✅ Monitoring software licenses (Hive OS, MinerStat, Awesome Miner)\n- ✅ Mining pool subscriptions (fees)\n- ✅ Tax management tools (Koinly, CryptoTax)\n- ✅ Cloud services for analytics\n\n#### 6. Advisory and professional services\n\n- ✅ Tax advisory and accounting\n- ✅ Legal advice\n- ✅ Specialized technical services\n- ✅ Audits\n\n#### 7. Insurance\n\n- ✅ Equipment insurance against theft/damage\n- ✅ Liability insurance\n- ✅ Business interruption insurance\n\n#### 8. Financing\n\n- ✅ Interest on loans to acquire equipment\n- ✅ Bank fees related to the activity\n\n#### 9. Training\n\n- ✅ Courses on mining, blockchain, optimization\n- ✅ Technical books and specialist subscriptions\n- ✅ Attendance at industry conferences and events\n\n### Mandatory documentation\n\nFor each deductible expense you must keep:\n\n- ✅ Invoice or receipt (with supplier’s tax ID)\n- ✅ Proof of payment (transfer, bank statement)\n- ✅ Clear relation to the economic activity\n- ✅ Entry in the expense ledger\n\n\n## Quarterly obligations: Modelos 130 and 303\n\n\n\n### Modelo 130: IRPF advance payments\n\n**Modelo 130** is a quarterly self-assessment through which you prepay 20% of your profit to the Tax Agency.\n\n### Who must file it\n\nYou are required to file if:\n\n- You are self-employed under the direct assessment regime\n- More than 70% of your income does **not** bear IRPF withholding\n\n(In crypto mining, 100% of your income has no withholding, so you **are** required.)\n\n### Calculating the advance payment\n\n```\nAdvance payment = (Cumulative income − Cumulative expenses) × 20%\n```\n\n**Minus:**\n- Prior quarterly advances in the same year\n- Withholdings borne (if any)\n\n### 2025 filing deadlines\n\n| Quarter | Period | Filing window |\n|---------|--------|---------------|\n| **Q1** | Jan–Mar | 1–20 April |\n| **Q2** | Apr–Jun | 1–20 July |\n| **Q3** | Jul–Sep | 1–20 October |\n| **Q4** | Oct–Dec | 1–30 January 2026 |\n\n### Practical example: First quarter\n\n**Q1 2025 activity:**\n- Mined crypto (market value): €15,000\n- Deductible expenses:\n  - Electricity: €1,200\n  - Equipment depreciation: €1,000\n  - Internet: €150\n  - Advisory: €300\n  - Total expenses: €2,650\n\n**Calculation:**\n```\nQuarterly profit = €15,000 − €2,650 = €12,350\nAdvance payment (20%) = €2,470\n```\n\nYou must pay **€2,470** by April 20.\n\n### Filing\n\n- Online: AEAT e-office\n- Payment via bank direct debit or NRC (Número de Referencia Completo)\n\n\n### Modelo 303: Quarterly VAT return\n\nAlthough mining is **NOT subject to VAT**, you must file Modelo 303 quarterly.\n\n### Return contents\n\n**Specific box:** Non-subject operations\n\nYou will indicate:\n- Mining activity: **non-subject operation**\n- Amount of the activity (informative)\n\n**Result:** Amount due = €0\n\n### Why file if it’s non-subject?\n\nInformational obligation so the AEAT is aware of your economic activity.\n\n### Filing deadlines\n\nSame as Modelo 130:\n- Q1: 1–20 April\n- Q2: 1–20 July\n- Q3: 1–20 October\n- Q4: 1–30 January\n\n### Annual return (Modelo 390)\n\nAt year-end, you must file the **annual VAT summary** (Modelo 390) in January.\n\n\n## Annual return (Modelo 100): inclusion in your income tax\n\nAt the end of the fiscal year, you must include all mining income in your **IRPF income tax return** (Modelo 100).\n\n### Relevant section\n\n**Income from economic activities under direct assessment:**\n\n- Boxes 086 to 094\n- “Professional activities” or “Business activities” section (depending on your classification)\n\n### Information to include\n\n**Total annual income:**\n- Sum of all cryptocurrencies mined, valued at market price at the time obtained\n\n**Deductible expenses by category:**\n- Operating consumables (electricity)\n- Leases (premises)\n- Repairs and maintenance\n- Independent professional services (advisory)\n- Other external services (internet, software)\n- Depreciation\n- Other expenses\n\n**Net income:**\n```\nNet income = Total income − Deductible expenses\n```\n\n### Integration with other income\n\nNet mining income is added to:\n- Employment income (if you are also an employee)\n- Other income from economic activities\n- Imputed income, etc.\n\nForming the **IRPF general base** on which progressive rates are applied.\n\n### Deducting advance payments\n\nQuarterly payments (Modelo 130) are **deducted** from the final tax due:\n\n**Full-year example:**\n\n```\nAnnual net income: €45,000\nCalculated IRPF (average rate 30%): €13,500\n\nLess:\n- Advance payments (Modelo 130): €9,000\n- Employment withholdings (if any): €0\n\n= Amount to pay: €4,500\n```\n\n### Filing window\n\nFrom **April 3 to June 30, 2026** (for tax year 2025)\n\n\n## Taxation when you sell the cryptocurrencies you have mined\n\nAfter mining cryptocurrencies and being taxed on their receipt, when you sell them you will face **a second layer of taxation** on the capital gain or loss.\n\n### Double taxation: mining + sale\n\n**Moment 1: When mining (economic activity)**\n- Market value is taxed as business income\n- IRPF general base (up to 47%)\n\n**Moment 2: Upon sale (capital gain)**\n- The difference between sale price and value at mining is taxed\n- IRPF savings base (19%–28%)\n\n### Full cycle example\n\n**March 15, 2024: You mine 0.5 BTC**\n- BTC price: €55,000/BTC\n- Value mined: €27,500\n- **2024 taxation:** €27,500 as business income\n- Estimated IRPF (30%): €8,250\n\n**Tax acquisition value for those 0.5 BTC: €27,500**\n\n**October 20, 2024: You sell the 0.5 BTC**\n- BTC price: €62,000/BTC\n- Sale price: €31,000\n- Acquisition value: €27,500\n- **Capital gain: €3,500**\n- IRPF (19%): €665\n\n**Total taxation:**\n- For mining: €8,250\n- For sale: €665\n- **Total: €8,915**\n\n### Capital losses: offset opportunities\n\nIf you sell at a loss, you may offset it:\n\n- ✅ Against other capital gains in the same year\n- ✅ Against investment income (up to 25%)\n- ✅ Against prior-year losses (4 years)\n\n**Loss example:**\n\nYou mine 1 ETH at €2,500 → Sell at €2,000 → Loss: €500\n\nThat loss reduces your savings base.\n\n\n## Complete practical case: professional miner in 2025\n\nLet’s look at a realistic example of a professional miner over a full year.\n\n### Miner profile: Alberto\n\n- **Activity:** Bitcoin mining in a pool\n- **Equipment:** 4 Antminer S19 Pro\n- **Initial investment:** €20,000\n- **Premises:** 20 m² room in a 100 m² home\n- **Dedicated electricity consumption:** 350 kWh/month\n- **First time self-employed:** Yes (flat rate available)\n\n### 2025 annual income\n\n**Mining rewards:**\n- Q1: 0.15 BTC → €8,250 (avg. €55,000/BTC)\n- Q2: 0.14 BTC → €8,260 (avg. €59,000/BTC)\n- Q3: 0.13 BTC → €7,800 (avg. €60,000/BTC)\n- Q4: 0.12 BTC → €7,680 (avg. €64,000/BTC)\n\n**Total income: €31,990**\n\n### 2025 deductible expenses\n\n**Electricity:**\n- Monthly consumption: 350 kWh × €0.30/kWh = €105/month\n- Annual: €1,260\n\n**Equipment depreciation:**\n- 4 ASICs: €20,000 × 25% = €5,000/year\n\n**Internet:**\n- €50/month × 12 = €600\n\n**Premises (20% of home):**\n- Rent: €700/month × 20% = €140/month\n- Annual: €1,680\n\n**Utilities (20% of home):**\n- HOA, insurance, IBI: €1,200 × 20% = €240\n\n**Professional services:**\n- Accounting and tax advisory: €1,500\n\n**Software and subscriptions:**\n- Hive OS + tools: €300\n\n**Training:**\n- Mining optimization course: €400\n\n**Total expenses: €10,980**\n\n### Net income\n\n```\nIncome: €31,990\nExpenses: €10,980\nNet income: €21,010\n```\n\n### Social Security contributions\n\n**With flat rate (first 12 months):**\n- €80/month × 12 = €960\n\n### Advance payments (Modelo 130)\n\n```\nQuarterly advances (20% of profit):\n\nQ1: (€8,250 − €2,745) × 20% = €1,101\nQ2: (€16,510 − €5,490 − €1,101) × 20% = €1,984\nQ3: (€24,310 − €8,235 − €3,085) × 20% = €2,598\nQ4: (€31,990 − €10,980 − €6,683) × 20% = €2,865\n\nTotal advances: €8,548\n```\n\n### Income tax return (Modelo 100)\n\n**General taxable base:**\n- Mining activity income: €21,010\n- Other income (employment): €0\n- **Total general base: €21,010**\n\n**Approximate IRPF calculation:**\n```\nUp to €12,450: €12,450 × 18.5% = €2,303\n€12,450 to €20,200: €7,750 × 24% = €1,860\n€20,200 to €21,010: €810 × 30% = €243\n\nTotal IRPF: €4,406\n```\n\n**Minus:**\n- Advance payments (Modelo 130): €8,548\n\n**Result: Refund of €4,142**\n\n(Advance payments exceeded the final tax due.)\n\n### Year-end financial summary\n\n```\nGross mining income: €31,990\nBusiness expenses: −€10,980\nSelf-employed contributions: −€960\nNet IRPF (after refund): €0 (refund exceeds payments)\n\nNet profit: €20,050\n\nNet return: €20,050 / €20,000 investment = 100% annual\n```\n\n**Additionally, he keeps:**\n- 0.54 BTC mined (current value: ~€34,000)\n- If sold, only the additional capital gain will be taxed\n\n\n## Common mistakes miners make (and how to avoid them)\n\n### Mistake 1: Not registering as self-employed\n\n**Problem:** Mining habitually without registering.\n\n**Consequence:**\n- Penalties for undeclared economic activity\n- Retroactive regularization of self-employment contributions\n- Tax assessments with surcharges\n\n**Solution:** Register BEFORE starting professional activity.\n\n### Mistake 2: Not valuing cryptocurrencies correctly when mined\n\n**Problem:** Using the sale value instead of the value at the time of mining.\n\n**Consequence:** Incorrect calculation of business income and capital gains.\n\n**Solution:** Record the exact market value of each mining reward at the moment you receive it.\n\n### Mistake 3: Not keeping expense documentation\n\n**Problem:** Claiming deductions without invoices or supporting docs.\n\n**Consequence:** In an audit, the AEAT may deny deductions and assess differences.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Always request an invoice with your tax ID (NIF)\n- Keep proof of payment\n- Maintain an organized archive for 4–6 years\n\n### Mistake 4: Confusing the taxation of mining with buying crypto\n\n**Problem:** Thinking mining is taxed the same as buying and selling.\n\n**Reality:**\n- Buying/selling: Capital gain (savings base, 19–28%)\n- Mining: Economic activity (general base, up to 47%)\n\n**Solution:** Clearly separate both activities in your bookkeeping.\n\n### Mistake 5: Not filing Modelo 130 quarterly\n\n**Problem:** Thinking the annual return is enough.\n\n**Consequence:**\n- Surcharges and late-payment interest\n- Penalties for not filing advance payments\n\n**Solution:** Set reminders to file Modelo 130 every quarter (April, July, October, January).\n\n### Mistake 6: Deducting 100% of mixed expenses\n\n**Problem:** Deducting the full electricity/internet bill when also used personally.\n\n**Consequence:** Unjustified expense that may be disallowed.\n\n**Solution:** Proportionally calculate mixed expenses and document your method.\n\n### Mistake 7: Not declaring cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges\n\n**Problem:** Holding over €50,000 in mined crypto on exchanges outside Spain without filing Modelo 721.\n\n**Consequence:** Penalties from €1,500 up to 150% of the undeclared value.\n\n**Solution:** File Modelo 721 in March if you exceed the thresholds.\n\n\n## Tax comparison: Is mining or buying crypto more profitable?\n\nFrom a tax perspective, here are the differences:\n\n### Cryptocurrency mining\n\n**Tax advantages:**\n- ✅ Deductible expenses (electricity, equipment, premises, etc.)\n- ✅ Depreciation of investments\n- ✅ Not subject to VAT\n- ✅ Potential self-employed flat rate\n\n**Tax disadvantages:**\n- ❌ Taxed in the general base (up to 47%)\n- ❌ Self-employment contributions (minimum ~€960 annually with flat rate)\n- ❌ Administrative obligations: Modelos 130, 303, accounting books\n- ❌ Double taxation: at mining + at sale\n\n### Buying and selling (trading)\n\n**Tax advantages:**\n- ✅ Taxed only on sale (savings base, 19–28%)\n- ✅ No self-employed obligations\n- ✅ No monthly contributions\n- ✅ Administrative simplicity\n\n**Tax disadvantages:**\n- ❌ No deductible expenses\n- ❌ Investments cannot be depreciated\n- ❌ Immediate taxation of gains upon sale\n\n### Comparative example\n\n**Scenario:** Invest €20,000 in crypto\n\n**Option A: Buy Bitcoin directly**\n- Investment: €20,000 in BTC\n- BTC rises 50% in 1 year → Value: €30,000\n- You sell: Gain €10,000\n- IRPF (21%): €2,100\n- **Net profit: €7,900**\n\n**Option B: Buy mining equipment**\n- Investment: €20,000 in ASICs\n- You mine €31,990 in 1 year (example above)\n- Deductible expenses: €10,980\n- Net income: €21,010\n- IRPF (avg. 21%): €4,406\n- Self-employed contributions: €960\n- **Net profit: €15,644**\n- **You also retain the equipment (residual value ~€10,000)**\n\n**Conclusion:** In this scenario, mining is fiscally more profitable if:\n- BTC’s price remains stable or rises moderately\n- You optimize deductible expenses\n- Mining difficulty does not spike dramatically\n\nBut trading is simpler and requires no technical skills or infrastructure.\n\n\n## Future of mining tax regulation in Spain\n\nThe taxation of cryptocurrency mining is constantly evolving.\n\n### Regulatory trends 2025–2026\n\n**1.

You have **access to cheap electricity** (< €0.10/kWh)\n2. You can **deduct significant expenses** (dedicated premises, equipment)\n3. You keep the activity **continuous** to amortize investment and contributions\n4. The **price of the mined crypto** stays stable or rises\n5. Network **difficulty** does not increase drastically\n\nIf these conditions are not met, trading (buy/sell) may be more tax-efficient.\n\n\n## Cleriontax: experts in crypto mining taxation\n\nAre you mining cryptocurrencies or planning to start?
