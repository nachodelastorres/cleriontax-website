  "content": "## Introduction\n\nIf you hold cryptocurrencies across multiple wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols, you know how hard it is to keep precise control over all your activity. Between transfers, swaps, staking, airdrops, and multichain operations, keeping a manual log can become a nightmare—especially when it’s time to file with the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT).\n\nFortunately, there are tools designed to **automatically track your blockchain transactions** and help you visualize your portfolio in real time. From free solutions like **DeBank** and **Zerion** to tax-focused platforms such as **CoinTracking** or **Koinly**, the market offers plenty of options.\n\nBut which one is best for your needs? Are they enough to comply with the tax authority? In this guide we analyze the main tools available, their advantages, limitations, and when you really need a professional service.\n\n---\n\n## Why do you need to track your cryptocurrencies?\n\nBefore diving into specific tools, it’s important to understand **why tracking your crypto activity is essential**:\n\n### 1. Tax obligation with the AEAT\n\nIn Spain, **all cryptocurrency transactions are taxable**. Every swap, sale, or exchange generates a capital gain or loss that you must declare in your income tax (IRPF). In addition, if your cryptocurrencies are held on foreign exchanges or non-custodial wallets and exceed €50,000, you must file form 721 (formerly 720).\n\nWithout an accurate record of all your transactions, it is practically impossible to correctly calculate your gains and fulfill your tax obligations.\n\n### 2. Portfolio management\n\nBeyond tax obligations, tracking your portfolio lets you:\n\n- **Visualize your exposure** to different assets and protocols\n- **Spot opportunities** for rebalancing or taking profits\n- **Calculate your true performance** across all chains and wallets\n- **Identify tax-loss opportunities** to offset gains\n\n### 3. Traceability and security\n\nHaving a complete record of your operations helps you:\n\n- Detect unauthorized or suspicious movements\n- Recover information if you lose access to wallets\n- Prove the legitimate origin of your funds if needed\n\n---\n\n## Free tools: DeBank and Zerion\n\nLet’s start with the most popular, accessible options to track your portfolio at no cost.\n\n### DeBank: the most complete multichain tracker\n\n**DeBank** has become one of the most powerful free tools for DeFi portfolio tracking.

Incorrect application of Spain’s FIFO rule\n\nThe AEAT requires the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** method to compute capital gains. Although many tools offer FIFO, their implementation often doesn’t match the Spanish interpretation, especially when there are:\n\n- Multiple wallets and exchanges\n- Transfers between your own accounts\n- Multichain operations of the same asset\n\n### 2. Incorrect tax classification\n\nIn Spain, according to the AEAT, crypto activities fall into:\n\n- **Capital gains** (Form 100 – IRPF)\n- **Investment income** (staking, lending)\n- **Business income** (if you’re a professional trader, miner, etc.)\n\nInternational tools don’t classify these correctly.\n\n### 3. Failure to identify Form 721 obligations\n\nIf your crypto held abroad exceeds €50,000, you must file **Form 721**. Automated tools:\n\n- Don’t correctly calculate this threshold\n- Don’t distinguish which assets are “abroad” per AEAT\n- Don’t generate the required format for this form\n\n### 4. Misclassification of complex DeFi operations\n\nTools frequently struggle with:\n\n- **Wrapped tokens** (WETH, stETH): Often counted as sales when they are 1:1 conversions\n- **Multichain bridging:** Logs two transactions (outflow + inflow) as separate taxable events\n- **LP tokens:** Don’t correctly account for exposure to IL (impermanent loss)\n- **Airdrops:** Don’t distinguish between free airdrops and activity-based rewards\n- **Failed transactions:** Sometimes record gas fees without an effective operation\n\n### 5. No reconciliation of internal transfers\n\nWhen you transfer your own funds between:\n\n- Wallet A → Exchange B\n- Exchange A → Wallet B\n- Ethereum wallet → Polygon wallet (bridging)\n\nTools may:\n\n- Treat them as sales (creating phantom gains/losses)\n- Duplicate transactions\n- Lose cost-basis traceability\n\nAlthough some tools like Koinly try to auto-detect them, the error rate remains high.\n\n### 6. No AEAT-ready documentation\n\nThe tools produce:\n\n- Generic CSVs or PDFs in English\n- Reports that don’t match Form 100 box structure\n- No references to Spanish regulations\n- No explanatory memorandum to accompany the filing\n\nThe tax authority may request **additional supporting documentation**, which these tools don’t provide.\n\n---\n\n## When do you need a professional service?\n\nAutomated tools can be a good starting point, but there are situations where **you need specialized professional advice**:\n\n### Cases that require a professional service:\n\n#### 1. High DeFi transaction volume\n\nIf you’ve been active in:\n- Multiple DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Curve, etc.)\n- Complex multichain operations\n- Liquidity mining and yield farming\n- NFTs (buying, selling, creating)\n\n**Why:** Automated tools misclassify most of these operations, creating cascading errors.\n\n#### 2. Portfolio spread across many platforms\n\nIf you hold crypto on:\n- More than 3–4 different exchanges\n- 5+ wallets across different blockchains\n- Foreign exchanges without available APIs\n- Sunset platforms or with no historical access\n\n**Why:** Reconciling internal transfers becomes extremely complex and error-prone.\n\n#### 3. You need to file Form 721\n\nIf your crypto assets abroad exceed €50,000:\n\n**Why:** Tools don’t correctly calculate this form, and mistakes can lead to **very high penalties** (minimum €10,000).\n\n#### 4. Historical operations or incomplete data\n\nIf:\n- You operated before 2018–2019 and some exchanges no longer exist\n- You lost access to old wallets\n- You don’t have complete records of some operations\n- You need to rebuild history via blockchain analysis\n\n**Why:** Requires specific methodology for blockchain traceability and cost-basis reconstruction.\n\n#### 5. Business activity with crypto\n\nIf:\n- You mined cryptocurrencies\n- You are an NFT creator\n- Professional trading (high frequency)\n- You received payments in crypto for services\n\n**Why:** These activities are taxed as **business income**, requiring IAE registration, quarterly filing (Form 130), and a completely different tax treatment.\n\n#### 6. Review or discrepancy with the tax authority\n\nIf:\n- The AEAT has sent you a notice\n- You need to file an amended return\n- You want to submit an appeal or claims\n\n**Why:** Requires deep knowledge of tax rules and AEAT specifics.\n\n### What a professional service provides\n\nA specialized crypto tax service like **Cleriontax** offers:\n\n✅ **Manual review** of all transactions, fixing automatic misclassifications\n\n✅ **Correct FIFO application** under AEAT criteria, including reconciliation of internal transfers\n\n✅ **Accurate tax classification** of each operation under Spanish rules:\n   - Capital gains\n   - Investment income\n   - Business income\n   - Non-taxable operations\n\n✅ **Form 721 calculation** where applicable, correctly identifying relevant assets and thresholds\n\n✅ **AEAT-ready reports** formatted and structured for Form 100, plus supporting documentation\n\n✅ **Explanatory memorandum** to accompany your return—useful if you receive a notice\n\n✅ **Personalized advice** on tax optimization, loss offsetting, and planning\n\n✅ **Support before the AEAT** in case of notices, audits, or discrepancies\n\n### How much does a professional service cost?\n\nPrices vary by complexity:\n\n- **Simple portfolio** (exchanges only, <200 transactions): from €150–€300\n- **Medium portfolio** (basic DeFi, multichain, 200–1,000 txs): €400–€800\n- **Complex portfolio** (advanced DeFi, multiple chains and protocols, >1,000 txs): €800–€2,000+\n\nIt seems expensive compared to tools costing €50–€150/year, but consider:\n\n- **Avoiding errors** that could cost thousands in penalties\n- **Saving time** (dozens of hours of manual work)\n- **Peace of mind** that your return is correct\n- **Representation before AEAT** if needed\n\n**ROI:** An error in capital gains or failing to file Form 721 can result in penalties of €10,000 or more. Investing in a professional service easily pays for itself by avoiding a single mistake.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Which tool should you choose?\n\nThe choice depends on your profile and needs:\n\n### Use free tools (DeBank, Zerion) if:\n\n- You only want **visual tracking** of your portfolio\n- You need to see your DeFi positions in real time\n- You are not preparing a tax return yet\n- You complement them with other tools for tax purposes\n\n**Recommendation:** DeBank for advanced DeFi, Zerion for simplicity and mobile.\n\n### Use paid tools (Koinly, CoinTracking) if:\n\n- Your portfolio is **relatively simple** (mainly exchanges)\n- You have few complex DeFi operations (<50 DeFi txs/year)\n- You’re willing to **review and correct** the report before filing\n- You have tax knowledge to adapt results to Spanish rules\n- You want an organized data base to later work with an advisor\n\n**Recommendation:** Koinly for ease of use; CoinTracking if you have high volume.\n\n### You need a professional service if:\n\n- Complex portfolio with **multichain DeFi**\n- More than **500 transactions/year**\n- You need to file **Form 721**\n- Business activity with crypto (mining, NFT creator, professional trader)\n- Incomplete historical data or discontinued exchanges\n- You’ve received a **notice from the AEAT**\n- You want **guaranteed accuracy** and to avoid costly mistakes\n- You value your time and prefer to delegate to experts\n\n### Combined strategy\n\nMany users combine tools:\n\n1. **DeBank/Zerion** → Day-to-day portfolio tracking\n2. **Koinly/CoinTracking** → Initial data organization\n3. **Professional service** → Review, correction, and final filing\n\nThis strategy **optimizes cost and accuracy**: leverage automation where it works well, but ensure tax accuracy where it matters most.\n\n### Final recommendation\n\nIf you’re reading this because you need to file your crypto taxes with the AEAT, our recommendation is clear:\n\n**Automated tools are useful, but they don’t replace professional review** for the Spanish market.\n\nCrypto taxation in Spain is complex and specific. AEAT criteria (FIFO, income classification, Form 721) require specialized knowledge that generic tools can’t provide.\n\nIf your portfolio includes DeFi, multichain operations, or exceeds 200–300 transactions per year, **investing in a professional service will save you time, money, and headaches**.\n\n### Need help with your crypto tax return?\n\nAt **Cleriontax** we specialize in cryptocurrency taxation in Spain. Our team combines:\n\n- **Tax expertise** with specific AEAT criteria\n- **Blockchain data analysis** for full traceability\n- **Manual review** of every transaction\n- **Professional reports** ready to file\n\nIf you want a **professional, accurate tax report** tailored to Spanish regulations, [**contact us**](/es/contacto) for a personalized assessment of your case.\n\nDon’t leave your tax return to chance. The difference between a generic tool and a professional service can be the difference between proper compliance and facing penalties and notices."
