  "content": "## Introduction: The Tax Maze of Cryptocurrencies in Spain\n\nIf you own cryptocurrencies in Spain, you have likely heard about **Form 100, Form 721 (formerly 720), and Form 714**. But do you really know which one you must file? When? And what happens if you don't?\n\nThe confusion is understandable: **AEAT** uses three different forms to control cryptocurrencies, each with different objectives, different deadlines, and most importantly, **penalties that can exceed €150,000** if you don't comply correctly.\n\nIn this complete guide we explain:\n\n- **What each form is** and what it's for\n- **When you must file** each one (and when NOT to)\n- **Key differences** between the three forms\n- **Specific penalties** for not filing them\n- **Common mistakes** taxpayers make\n- **Answers to frequently asked questions** in FAQ format\n\nBy the end of this reading, you will have absolute clarity about your tax obligations with cryptocurrencies before AEAT.\n\n---\n\n## Form 100: Income Tax Return (IRPF)\n\n### What is Form 100?\n\n**Form 100 is the annual IRPF (Personal Income Tax) return**. It's the form we all know as \"the income tax return\".\n\nWhen you operate with cryptocurrencies, you must declare in Form 100:\n\n#### 1. Capital gains and losses\n\nEvery time you sell, exchange, or use cryptocurrencies, you generate a **change in assets** that must be declared:\n\n- **Selling crypto for euros:** BTC → EUR\n- **Exchange between cryptos:** BTC → ETH\n- **Payment with cryptocurrencies:** Buying a product paying with BTC\n- **Conversion to stablecoins:** BTC → USDT (yes, it also taxes)\n\nThese operations are declared in **boxes 1624-1649** of Form 100, depending on whether they are short-term (<1 year) or long-term (>1 year) gains/losses.\n\n**Important:** The **FIFO (First In, First Out)** method is applied, which means the first cryptocurrencies you bought are considered the first ones sold when calculating gains.\n\n#### 2. Income from movable capital\n\nIf you generate passive income with your cryptocurrencies, they are taxed as income from movable capital:\n\n- **Staking:** Rewards for validating transactions\n- **Lending:** Interest for lending your cryptos on DeFi or CeFi platforms\n- **Passive airdrops:** Tokens received without prior activity\n- **Interest on crypto accounts:** \"Savings account\" type returns on Nexo, Celsius, etc.\n\nThese are declared in **boxes 0027-0046** of Form 100 and are taxed as capital income, with withholding applicable as appropriate.\n\n#### 3. Income from economic activities\n\nIf your cryptocurrency activity is professional or habitual, it may be considered **economic activity**:\n\n- **Cryptocurrency mining** (see our specific article on mining)\n- **Professional high-frequency trading**\n- **Creation and sale of NFTs** as main activity\n- **Receiving payments in crypto** for professional services\n\nIn these cases, you must register in **IAE (Economic Activities Tax)**, file quarterly returns (Form 130/131), and income is declared in **boxes 0086-0197** of Form 100.\n\n### When is Form 100 filed?\n\n**Deadline:** From **April 11 to June 30** of the year following the fiscal year.\n\n- For 2024 operations → Filing between April-June 2025\n- For 2025 operations → Filing between April-June 2026\n\n**Filing obligation:**\n\nYou are required to file Form 100 if:\n\n- Your work income exceeds €22,000 (from a single payer) or €15,000 (multiple payers)\n- You have capital gains (including crypto) exceeding €1,000\n- Movable capital income exceeding €1,600\n- Other specific circumstances of IRPF regulations\n\n**Important for crypto:** Even if you're not required to file due to your work income, **if you have cryptocurrency operations that generate gains, you're probably required to file Form 100**.\n\n### What documentation do I need for Form 100 with cryptocurrencies?\n\nTo correctly declare your cryptocurrencies in Form 100 you need:\n\n1. **Complete record of all your transactions:**\n   - Date of each operation\n   - Type of operation (purchase, sale, swap, etc.)\n   - Amount in euros at the time of transaction\n   - Cryptocurrency involved and quantity\n\n2. **Correct calculation of gains/losses:**\n   - Application of FIFO method\n   - Acquisition price vs transfer price\n   - Reconciliation of transfers between wallets/exchanges\n\n3. **Supporting documents:**\n   - Exchange statements\n   - Blockchain transaction history\n   - Wallet certificates\n\n**Reality:** With hundreds or thousands of transactions, especially if you've operated in multichain DeFi, this becomes extremely complex. That's why specialized professional services like Cleriontax exist.\n\n---\n\n## Form 721: Informative Declaration of Virtual Currencies Abroad\n\n### What is Form 721?\n\n**Form 721** is the evolution of the old Form 720, specifically adapted for **cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies located abroad**.\n\nIt's an **annual informative declaration** where you must inform AEAT about:\n\n- Cryptocurrency balances on foreign exchanges\n- Cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets (according to AEAT interpretation)\n- Virtual currencies on DeFi platforms\n- Any virtual assets hosted outside Spain\n\n**Important:** It's not a tax return (you don't pay taxes for filing Form 721). It's **purely informative**, but penalties for not filing are the most severe in the entire Spanish tax system.\n\n### When must I file Form 721?\n\n**Filing obligation:**\n\nYou must file Form 721 if on **December 31** of the fiscal year:\n\n1. You have cryptocurrencies abroad **worth more than €50,000**\n2. It's the **first time** you exceed that threshold, or\n3. The balance has **increased by more than €20,000** compared to the last declaration filed\n\n**Practical examples:**\n\n**Example 1 - First filing:**\n- 31/12/2024: You have €60,000 in crypto on Binance (foreign exchange)\n- ✅ **Required to file** Form 721 in 2025\n- Deadline: From January 1 to March 31, 2025\n\n**Example 2 - Not required:**\n- 31/12/2024: You have €45,000 in crypto on Binance\n- ❌ **Not required** (doesn't exceed €50,000)\n\n**Example 3 - Significant increase:**\n- 31/12/2023: You had €60,000 (filed Form 721 in 2024)\n- 31/12/2024: You have €85,000 (increase of €25,000)\n- ✅ **Required to file** again (increase >€20,000)\n\n**Example 4 - Not required despite having crypto:**\n- 31/12/2023: You had €60,000 (filed Form 721 in 2024)\n- 31/12/2024: You have €65,000 (increase of €5,000)\n- ❌ **Not required** (increase <€20,000)\n\n### When is Form 721 filed?\n\n**Deadline:** From **January 1 to March 31** of the following year.\n\n- For balances at 31/12/2024 → Filing between January-March 2025\n- For balances at 31/12/2025 → Filing between January-March 2026\n\n**Important:** The deadline is **different from Form 100**. Many taxpayers make the mistake of thinking it's filed together with the income tax return, but Form 721 is filed in the **first quarter of the year**.\n\n### What cryptocurrencies are considered \"abroad\"?\n\nThis is one of the most frequent questions and where there's most confusion. According to AEAT:\n\n#### ✅ Yes, considered \"abroad\" (must declare in Form 721):\n\n1. **Foreign exchanges:**\n   - Binance (Malta/Cayman Islands)\n   - Coinbase (USA)\n   - Kraken (USA)\n   - KuCoin (Seychelles)\n   - Bitfinex (Hong Kong)\n   - And any other exchange not registered in Spain\n\n2. **Non-custodial wallets according to AEAT:**\n   - MetaMask\n   - Ledger\n   - Trezor\n   - Trust Wallet\n   - Any wallet where you control the private keys\n\n   **AEAT justification:** Although you control the keys, cryptocurrencies \"exist\" on the blockchain, which is not located in Spain.\n\n3. **DeFi protocols:**\n   - Funds deposited in Aave, Compound, Uniswap, etc.\n   - Liquidity pools\n   - Staking on decentralized protocols\n   - Any smart contract that custodies your assets\n\n#### ❌ Not considered \"abroad\" (don't declare in Form 721):\n\n1. **Spanish exchanges:**\n   - Bit2Me (Spain)\n   - Any exchange with registered office and registration in Spain\n\n**Important:** Currently, virtually **all major exchanges are abroad**, which means most users with more than €50,000 in crypto are required to file Form 721.\n\n### Form 721 penalties: the harshest in the tax system\n\nForm 721 has the **most severe penalty regime in all Spanish tax regulations**:\n\n#### Penalty for not filing or filing late:\n\n**Minimum fine:** €10,000 per data item or set of omitted data, with a **minimum of €10,000 per information block**.\n\n**Maximum fine:** Can reach up to **150% of the undeclared balance** if AEAT considers there was intent to conceal.\n\n#### Examples of real penalties:\n\n**Case 1 - Oversight without bad faith:**\n- You have €60,000 on Binance\n- You forgot to file Form 721\n- Penalty: **Minimum €10,000** (even without concealment)\n\n**Case 2 - Multiple exchanges:**\n- You have €40,000 on Binance, €30,000 on Coinbase, €25,000 on Kraken\n- Total: €95,000 (exceeds threshold)\n- Didn't file Form 721\n- Penalty: **Potentially €30,000** (€10,000 per undeclared exchange)\n\n**Case 3 - Presumption of concealment:**\n- You have €200,000 on foreign exchanges\n- Didn't declare on Form 721\n- AEAT considers you were concealing to evade taxes\n- Penalty: **Up to 150% of €200,000 = €300,000**\n\n#### Extended prescription:\n\nThe worst part: if you don't file Form 721, **the prescription period for your tax obligations extends from 4 to 10 years**.\n\nThis means AEAT can review and penalize operations from up to 10 years ago if you didn't declare Form 721 correctly.\n\n### How to correct Form 721 after the deadline\n\nIf you realized you should have filed Form 721 and didn't, **act immediately:**\n\n1. **File Form 721 as soon as possible** through late declaration\n2. The penalty **is significantly reduced** if you file voluntarily before AEAT requires you\n3. You can benefit from **50% reduction of the penalty** if you acknowledge the facts\n4. Consider **consulting with a professional** before filing to minimize risks\n\n**Don't wait:** The later you file, the higher the penalty and greater the risk of AEAT considering it intentional concealment.\n\n---\n\n## Form 714: Informative Declaration on Assets and Rights Abroad\n\n### What is Form 714?\n\n**Form 714** is the **Wealth Tax** declaration, a tax that taxes the net wealth (assets minus liabilities) of individuals.\n\n**Current status:** Wealth Tax is **100% exempt in almost all Autonomous Communities** since 2023, so most taxpayers **don't pay tax**, but some **must file the informative declaration**.\n\n### Must I include cryptocurrencies in Form 714?\n\n**Yes, if you file Form 714, you must include your cryptocurrencies** as part of your wealth.\n\nCryptocurrencies are declared as:\n\n- **\"Other assets and rights with economic content\"** (box 48 or similar depending on region)\n- Valued at their **market value on December 31**\n- Both crypto in Spain and abroad are declared\n\n### When must I file Form 714?\n\n**Filing obligation:**\n\nYou must file Form 714 if:\n\n1. Your net wealth exceeds **€2,000,000** (depending on region, may vary), or\n2. You have assets or rights abroad worth more than **€50,000** (even if your total wealth is less)\n\n**Important for crypto:** If you have **more than €50,000 in cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges or wallets**, even if your total wealth is less, **you're required to file Form 714**.\n\n### When is Form 714 filed?\n\n**Deadline:** From **April 11 to June 30** (same as Form 100).\n\n- For wealth at 31/12/2024 → Filing between April-June 2025\n\n### Difference between Form 721 and 714\n\nThis is a **very frequent** confusion:\n\n| Aspect | Form 721 | Form 714 |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Type** | Informative declaration of crypto abroad | Wealth Tax Declaration |\n| **Threshold** | €50,000 in crypto abroad | €2M wealth or €50,000 assets abroad |\n| **What it includes** | Only cryptocurrencies abroad | All wealth (real estate, stocks, crypto, accounts, etc.) |\n| **Deadline** | January 1 - March 31 | April 11 - June 30 |\n| **Tax** | Doesn't pay tax (only informative) | May pay tax (100% exempt in most regions) |\n| **Penalties** | Very high (minimum €10,000) | Moderate (€150-600 for late filing) |\n\n**Practical example:**\n\nYou have €80,000 in cryptocurrencies on Binance and €100,000 in a bank account in Spain. Total wealth: €180,000.\n\n- ✅ **Required to file Form 721** (crypto abroad >50k)\n- ✅ **Required to file Form 714** (assets abroad >50k, even though total wealth <2M)\n- ✅ **Required to file Form 100** (if you have income or capital gains)\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### What happens if I don't file Form 721?\n\n**Answer:** The consequences are **extremely serious**:\n\n1. **Minimum penalty of €10,000** per omitted information block\n2. **Extension of prescription period** from 4 to 10 years\n3. **Presumption of unjustified gains:** AEAT can presume your cryptocurrencies are undeclared capital gains and tax them at the maximum marginal rate (up to 28%)\n4. **Possible tax crime:** If the defrauded amount exceeds €120,000, it may constitute tax crime (prison sentence of 1 to 5 years)\n\n**Recommendation:** If you realize you should have filed Form 721 and didn't, **file a late declaration immediately** and consult with a professional. The penalty is significantly reduced if you act before AEAT requires you.\n\n### Do I have to file all 3 forms (100, 721 and 714)?\n\n**Answer:** It depends on your specific situation.\n\n**Common scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario 1 - Small portfolio (<50k):**\n- You have €30,000 in crypto on Binance\n- You've made some operations with gains of €5,000\n- Total wealth: €80,000\n- **Obligations:** Only Form 100 ✅ (declare capital gains)\n\n**Scenario 2 - Medium portfolio (50-200k):**\n- You have €100,000 in crypto on foreign exchanges\n- You've traded and have gains of €15,000\n- Total wealth: €150,000\n- **Obligations:** Form 100 ✅, Form 721 ✅, Form 714 ✅\n\n**Scenario 3 - Large portfolio (>500k):**\n- You have €600,000 in crypto distributed between exchanges and DeFi\n- You've actively traded with gains of €80,000\n- Total wealth: €800,000\n- **Obligations:** Form 100 ✅, Form 721 ✅, Form 714 ✅\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Form 100:** Almost always required if you operate with crypto\n- **Form 721:** Only if you exceed €50,000 in crypto abroad\n- **Form 714:** Only if you have >50k abroad or wealth >€2M\n\n### How do I know if my cryptocurrencies are \"abroad\"?\n\n**Answer:** Apply this quick guide:\n\n**✅ Abroad (declare Form 721 if >50k):**\n\n1. **Foreign exchanges:** Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, Bitfinex, etc.\n2. **Non-custodial wallets:** MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor, Trust Wallet, etc.\n3. **DeFi protocols:** Aave, Compound, Uniswap, Curve, etc.\n4. **General rule:** If the exchange/platform DOESN'T have its registered office in Spain and ISN'T registered with CNMV → It's foreign\n\n**❌ In Spain (don't declare Form 721, only Form 100):**\n\n1. **Spanish exchanges:** Bit2Me and others with headquarters in Spain\n2. **Spanish banks with crypto services** (if any)\n\n**Special case - Non-custodial wallets:**\n\nAEAT considers that cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets are \"abroad\" because the blockchain is not physically in Spain.\n\n**AEAT criterion:** If you have €60,000 in your Ledger (non-custodial wallet), you must declare it on Form 721.\n\n**Controversy:** This criterion is legally questionable, as you completely control the private keys. However, it's AEAT's **official position** currently, and we recommend complying to avoid penalties.\n\n### Can I file Form 721 after the deadline?\n\n**Answer:** Yes, you can file a **late declaration**, but you'll have penalties.\n\n**Types of late filing:**\n\n1. **Late without prior requirement:**\n   - You file voluntarily after March 31\n   - Penalty: From €150 to €10,000 depending on delay and circumstances\n   - **50% reduction** if you acknowledge the facts and don't appeal\n\n2. **After AEAT requirement:**\n   - AEAT has sent you a requirement\n   - You file after the requirement\n   - Penalty: Minimum €10,000, without significant reductions\n   - Possible 150% penalty of balance if concealment is considered\n\n**Advice:** If you realized you forgot to file Form 721, **do it immediately** through late declaration. The longer you wait, the worse.\n\n### What happens if my cryptocurrency value drops below €50,000?\n\n**Answer:** It depends on whether you had previously filed Form 721.\n\n**Scenario 1 - First time:**\n- 31/12/2024: You have €60,000 in crypto on Binance\n- You file Form 721 in March 2025 ✅\n- 31/12/2025: You have €35,000 (market dropped)\n- **Required to file in 2026?** ❌ NO (no increase >20k)\n\n**Scenario 2 - Never exceeded 50k:**\n- 31/12/2024: You have €40,000 in crypto\n- 31/12/2025: You have €30,000\n- **Required to file?** ❌ NO (never exceeded €50,000)\n\n**Important:** The obligation is evaluated on **December 31** of each year. Fluctuations during the year don't matter, only the balance at year-end.\n\n### Do I have to declare stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI)?\n\n**Answer:** **Yes, absolutely.**\n\nStablecoins are **cryptocurrencies** for tax purposes, even though their value is stable relative to the dollar or euro.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n1. **Form 721:** If you have 60,000 USDT on Binance, you exceed the €50,000 threshold and must file Form 721\n\n2. **Form 100:**\n   - Converting BTC → USDT is a taxable operation (generates capital gain/loss)\n   - Many users think converting to stablecoin doesn't tax. **This is FALSE.**\n   - AEAT considers USDT as any other cryptocurrency, not as euros\n\n3. **Form 714:** They're included in your wealth at market value (1 USDT ≈ €1 or $1)\n\n**Common error:** \"I converted my Bitcoin to USDT to protect from volatility, I didn't sell to euros, so I don't tax.\" **FALSE.** BTC → USDT is an exchange that generates change in assets.\n\n### How do transfers between exchanges affect my tax obligations?\n\n**Answer:** Transfers between your own exchanges/wallets **DO NOT generate tax**, but **you must declare them correctly to avoid calculation errors.**\n\n**Example:**\n\n1. You buy 1 BTC on Coinbase for €40,000\n2. You transfer that 1 BTC to Binance\n3. You sell the 1 BTC on Binance for €50,000\n\n**Fiscally:**\n- The transfer Coinbase → Binance **doesn't tax** (it's just an internal movement)\n- The sale on Binance does tax: Gain = €50,000 - €40,000 = €10,000\n- You must declare €10,000 capital gain on Form 100\n\n**Common problem:**\n\nAutomatic software (CoinTracking, Koinly, etc.) often **doesn't correctly reconcile** these internal transfers and may:\n- Count them as two independent operations (sale on Coinbase + purchase on Binance)\n- Lose traceability of acquisition cost\n- Duplicate gains or create phantom losses\n\n**Solution:** You need **manual reconciliation** or professional service that correctly identifies and labels all internal transfers.\n\n### What documentation must I keep to justify my cryptocurrency operations?\n\n**Answer:** AEAT can require supporting documentation for your crypto operations. You must keep:\n\n**Basic documentation:**\n\n1. **Exchange statements:**\n   - Complete history of operations (buy/sell/trading)\n   - History of deposits and withdrawals\n   - Screenshots of your portfolio on 31/12\n\n2. **Blockchain transaction history:**\n   - Records of on-chain transfers\n   - Transaction hashes (TxHash) of important operations\n   - Your own wallet addresses\n\n3. **Proof of fund origin:**\n   - Bank transfers to exchanges\n   - Crypto purchase receipts\n   - Invoices if you bought crypto by card\n\n4. **DeFi operation records:**\n   - Captures of positions in protocols\n   - History of swaps on DEXs (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)\n   - Staking and farming records\n\n5. **Calculations and methodology:**\n   - Spreadsheet or report showing how you calculated gains/losses\n   - FIFO method application\n   - Internal transfer reconciliation\n\n**Retention period:** **6 years** from declaration filing (4 years prescription + 2 years safety).\n\n**Important:** If you didn't file Form 721, the period extends to **10 years**.\n\n### Can I offset cryptocurrency losses with gains?\n\n**Answer:** **Yes**, you can offset capital losses and gains, but with limitations.\n\n**Offset rules:**\n\n1. **Within the same fiscal year:**\n   - You can freely offset gains and losses from the same year\n   - Example: You gained €10,000 with BTC and lost €4,000 with ETH → Net gain: €6,000\n\n2. **Losses from previous years:**\n   - You can offset losses from up to **4 previous years**\n   - Limit: Up to **25% of gains** each year (with exceptions depending on year)\n\n3. **Offset order:**\n   - First, gains and losses from the same year are offset\n   - Then losses from previous years are applied (oldest first)\n\n**Practical example:**\n\n- 2023: You lost €20,000 with cryptocurrencies (didn't offset, carry forward)\n- 2024: You gained €30,000 with cryptocurrencies\n- 2024 offset: You can offset up to 25% of €30,000 = €7,500\n- Result: You tax on €22,500 (30,000 - 7,500)\n- Pending losses: €12,500 (20,000 - 7,500) to offset in following years\n\n**Important:** To apply the offset, **you must have correctly declared losses at the time**. You can't \"invent\" losses from previous years.\n\n### What happens if I received an airdrop or cryptocurrency fork?\n\n**Answer:** It depends on the type of airdrop/fork.\n\n**Airdrops:**\n\n1. **Free airdrop without prior activity:**\n   - Example: You received tokens just for having a wallet\n   - **Taxation:** Movable capital income when received\n   - Value: Market price of token at airdrop time\n   - Declared on Form 100, capital income boxes\n\n2. **Airdrop for activity (Rewards):**\n   - Example: You received tokens for using a protocol, providing liquidity, etc.\n   - **Taxation:** Movable capital income\n   - Some cases may be considered economic activity income\n\n3. **Later sale of airdrop:**\n   - When you sell airdrop tokens, it generates capital gain/loss\n   - Acquisition cost: The value you declared when received\n\n**Forks (blockchain splits):**\n\n- Example: You had Bitcoin and received Bitcoin Cash after the 2017 fork\n- **AEAT criterion:** Doesn't tax at fork time (no capital increase, you just have two assets where before you had one)\n- **Taxation:** When you sell the forked coins\n- **Problem:** How is acquisition cost split between original and forked coin? Criterion: Proportionally to market value at fork time\n\n### How does cryptocurrency staking tax?\n\n**Answer:** Staking taxes as **movable capital income** on Form 100.\n\n**Taxation moment:**\n\nYou must tax when **you receive staking rewards**, not when you sell them.\n\n**Example:**\n- You stake 10 ETH on Ethereum 2.0\n- During 2024 you receive 0.5 ETH rewards\n- ETH price when you received rewards: €2,000 average\n- **Taxation:** 0.5 × €2,000 = €1,000 movable capital income\n- You declare it on Form 100, capital income boxes\n\n**Later sale of rewards:**\n\nWhen you sell those 0.5 ETH you received from staking:\n- If you sell them for €2,500\n- Acquisition cost: €1,000 (what you declared when received)\n- Capital gain: €2,500 - €1,000 = €1,500\n- Declared in capital gains of Form 100\n\n**Important:** They tax **twice**:\n1. As income when you receive rewards\n2. As capital gain when you sell them (if they increase in value)\n\nThis is not technically \"double taxation\", they're two different taxable events.\n\n---\n\n## Common mistakes when declaring cryptocurrencies\n\n### Error 1: Not filing Form 721 due to ignorance\n\n**The most costly error.** Many taxpayers with cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges are unaware of Form 721's existence or believe it's only for bank accounts.\n\n**Consequence:** Minimum penalties of €10,000 and prescription extension to 10 years.\n\n**Solution:** If you have more than €50,000 in crypto on foreign exchanges or wallets, **file Form 721 before March 31**.\n\n### Error 2: Thinking converting to stablecoin doesn't tax\n\n**Very frequent error:** \"I sold Bitcoin and converted it to USDT to protect from volatility, but since I didn't convert to euros, I don't tax.\"\n\n**Reality:** BTC → USDT is an **exchange between cryptocurrencies** that generates capital gain or loss.\n\n**Consequence:** Undeclared gains that AEAT can discover and penalize.\n\n**Solution:** All conversions between cryptocurrencies tax, including conversions to/from stablecoins.\n\n### Error 3: Not reconciling internal transfers\n\n**Error:** Transferring crypto between your own exchanges/wallets and calculation software counting it as:\n- Sale on exchange A + Purchase on exchange B\n- Creating phantom gains or losses\n\n**Consequence:** Incorrect declaration, paying more or less taxes than due.\n\n**Solution:** Identify and label all internal transfers so they're not counted as taxable operations.\n\n### Error 4: Not correctly applying FIFO method\n\n**Error:** Calculating gains using cost of last purchased cryptocurrencies (LIFO) instead of first (FIFO).\n\n**Consequence:** Incorrect capital gains calculation.\n\n**Error example:**\n\n- January 2024: You buy 1 BTC at €35,000\n- June 2024: You buy 1 BTC at €55,000\n- December 2024: You sell 1 BTC at €60,000\n\n**INCORRECT calculation (LIFO):**\n- Gain = €60,000 - €55,000 = €5,000 ❌\n\n**CORRECT calculation (FIFO):**\n- Gain = €60,000 - €35,000 = €25,000 ✅\n\n**Solution:** Use software that correctly applies FIFO or professional service.\n\n### Error 5: Not declaring airdrops and forks\n\n**Error:** Thinking tokens received \"free\" from airdrops don't tax.\n\n**Reality:** Airdrops tax as movable capital income when received.\n\n**Consequence:** Undeclared income.\n\n**Solution:** Record all airdrops you receive, their value when received, and declare it as capital income.\n\n### Error 6: Confusing Form 721 and Form 100 deadlines\n\n**Error:** Thinking Form 721 is filed in April-June together with income tax.\n\n**Reality:** Form 721 is filed in **January-March**, while Form 100 is filed in **April-June**.\n\n**Consequence:** Late filing of Form 721 with minimum penalty of €10,000.\n\n**Solution:** Mark on your calendar:\n- **January-March:** Form 721 (if you have >50k in crypto abroad)\n- **April-June:** Form 100 (income tax) and Form 714 (wealth, if applicable)\n\n### Error 7: Not keeping supporting documentation\n\n**Error:** Not keeping exchange statements, blockchain records, or operation receipts.\n\n**Consequence:** If AEAT requires documentation and you can't justify your operations, it may:\n- Presume your cryptocurrencies are undeclared capital gains\n- Apply maximum marginal rate without allowing offsets\n- Penalize for insufficient documentation\n\n**Solution:** Keep all documentation for at least 6 years (10 years if you didn't file Form 721).\n\n### Error 8: Blindly trusting automatic software\n\n**Error:** Using CoinTracking, Koinly or other tools and assuming the result is correct for AEAT.\n\n**Reality:** These tools:\n- Aren't specifically adapted to AEAT criteria\n- Don't correctly distinguish income types according to Spanish regulations\n- Don't automatically calculate Form 721 or 714\n- Have high error rates in complex DeFi operations\n\n**Consequence:** Incorrect declaration that may result in penalties.\n\n**Solution:** Use these tools as a database, but review the result with a professional specialized in Spanish crypto taxation before filing.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Don't leave your crypto tax obligations to chance\n\nCryptocurrency taxation in Spain is complex, with **three different forms** (100, 721 and 714), different deadlines, and penalties that can exceed €150,000.\n\n**Summary of obligations:**\n\n✅ **Form 100 (IRPF)** → Almost always required if you operate with crypto\n- Deadline: April-June\n- Declare: Capital gains/losses, capital income, economic activity income\n\n✅ **Form 721** → Required if you have >€50,000 in crypto abroad\n- Deadline: January-March\n- Declare: Balance at 31/12 on foreign exchanges and wallets\n- Penalties: Minimum €10,000, up to 150% of balance\n\n✅ **Form 714 (Wealth)** → Required if wealth >€2M or foreign assets >50k\n- Deadline: April-June\n- Declare: All wealth (including crypto)\n\n**Most costly errors:**\n\n1. Not filing Form 721 (minimum penalty €10,000)\n2. Thinking conversions to stablecoin don't tax\n3. Not correctly applying FIFO\n4. Confusing filing deadlines\n5.
