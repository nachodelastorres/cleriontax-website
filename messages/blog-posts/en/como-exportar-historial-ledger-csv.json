  "content": "**Ledger** is the world’s most popular hardware wallet manufacturer, with millions of devices sold that securely store Bitcoin, Ethereum, and hundreds of cryptocurrencies. The combination of Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X, or Stax devices with the **Ledger Live** app provides a complete digital asset management experience.\n\nBut when it’s time to prepare your **income tax return** or respond to a tax authority request, many users discover that exporting their tax history from Ledger Live is not as straightforward as it might seem.\n\nAn incomplete or poorly structured export can lead to:\n\n- Tax returns with errors that result in penalties from the AEAT\n- Inability to justify the origin of your cryptocurrencies during an audit\n- Incorrect calculations of the FIFO method required in Spain\n- Omission of staking rewards, swaps, or income that must be declared\n- Loss of traceability in multichain operations\n\nIn this **complete and up-to-date 2025 guide**, we explain step by step how to correctly export all your Ledger Live operations, how to interpret the exported data, what additional information you need, and how to organize everything for your tax filing with the AEAT.\n\n---\n\n## Why Ledger is different: hardware wallet vs software wallet\n\nBefore diving into the export process, it’s essential to understand what makes Ledger different from other wallets and why this affects how you should manage your tax history.\n\n### Ledger’s security architecture\n\nLedger is a **hardware wallet** (physical wallet) that stores your private keys in a secure chip isolated from the internet. Unlike software wallets like Metamask, your keys never leave the physical device, providing an additional layer of protection against hacks and malware.\n\n**Ledger Live** is the desktop and mobile application that acts as an interface to:\n\n- View your balances and transactions\n- Send and receive cryptocurrencies\n- Perform staking on supported assets\n- Execute swaps between different tokens\n- Interact with DeFi applications via Ledger Connect\n\n### Key differences between Ledger and other options\n\n| Feature | Exchange (Binance) | Software Wallet (Metamask) | Hardware Wallet (Ledger) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Key custody** | The exchange | You (on device) | You (offline secure chip) |\n| **Native CSV export** | Yes (multiple sections) | No | Yes (limited) |\n| **In-app history** | Complete | Partial | Complete in Ledger Live |\n| **Multiple blockchains** | Yes | Yes (configurable) | Yes (apps per blockchain) |\n| **DeFi operations** | Limited | Full | Via Ledger Connect |\n| **Integrated staking** | Yes | No | Yes (some assets) |\n| **Security** | Medium (custodial) | High | Very high |\n\n### What Ledger Live actually records\n\nLedger Live synchronizes blockchain information for all the accounts you have added. This includes:\n\n- **Incoming transactions:** Deposits received from exchanges, other wallets, or payments\n- **Outgoing transactions:** Transfers to exchanges, other wallets, or payments\n- **Staking:** Delegations, undelegations, and rewards received\n- **Internal swaps:** Exchanges performed through Ledger Live’s swap service\n- **Network fees:** Gas fees and transaction fees paid\n\nHowever, there is information that Ledger Live **cannot capture directly**:\n\n- Operations carried out in DeFi via WalletConnect that do not pass through Ledger Live\n- The original acquisition price of your cryptocurrencies if you bought them elsewhere\n- Interactions with complex smart contracts on certain networks\n\n---\n\n## Tax obligations with hardware wallets in Spain\n\nAs a Ledger user in Spain, your tax obligations are identical to those of any other form of cryptocurrency ownership. It’s a common mistake to think that using an “offline” hardware wallet means nothing needs to be declared.\n\n### Capital gains and losses\n\nEvery time you sell, exchange, or swap cryptocurrencies, you generate a capital gain or loss. This includes:\n\n- Selling Bitcoin for euros\n- Exchanging Ethereum for another cryptocurrency\n- Paying with cryptocurrencies for goods or services\n- Performing swaps through Ledger Live\n\nAll these operations must be declared in the [model 100 applying the FIFO method](/blog/como-declarar-criptomonedas-renta-2025), which establishes that the first cryptocurrencies you bought are the first ones you sell for gain calculation purposes.\n\n### Model 721: cryptocurrencies abroad\n\nHere is a point that causes a lot of confusion. Hardware wallets like Ledger are physical devices located in your home, but **the cryptocurrencies are not on the device**. They are on the blockchain, which is a global decentralized network.\n\nFor this reason, the AEAT considers cryptocurrencies held in non-custodial wallets (including hardware wallets) to be “located abroad” for the purposes of [model 721](/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas). If the total value of your cryptocurrencies exceeds €50,000 as of December 31, you are required to file this informative return.\n\nYou can explore all formal obligations in more detail in our guide on [models 100, 721, and 714 for cryptocurrencies](/blog/modelos-100-721-714-criptomonedas).\n\n### Investment income\n\nIf you use Ledger Live’s staking feature for assets such as Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, or Polkadot, the rewards you receive are **investment income**. They must be declared at the market price at the time they are received.\n\nThe same applies if you have received airdrops to addresses managed by your Ledger. Even if you did nothing to obtain them, they have tax implications you need to be aware of. Our [DeFi taxation guide](/blog/fiscalidad-defi-espana) explains in detail how these returns are taxed.\n\n---\n\n## Types of operations you must export from Ledger\n\nTo prepare a complete tax return, you need to identify and document all the types of operations you have carried out with your Ledger.\n\n### 1. Deposits and receipts\n\nThese include transfers from centralized exchanges, transfers from your own wallets, transfers received from third parties, airdrops, and protocol rewards.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Deposits from your own exchanges or wallets **do not generate taxation** (internal movements)\n- Transfers received from third parties as payment **are taxable** (gain or loss depending on original acquisition price)\n- Airdrops must be valued at the market price at the time of receipt\n\n### 2. Outgoing transfers\n\nThese include transfers to exchanges for sale, transfers to your own wallets, payments for goods or services, and donations.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Transfers to your own exchanges or wallets **are not taxable** if you can prove you control both\n- Payments made with crypto **do generate a capital gain or loss**\n- Donations have their own specific tax treatment\n\n### 3. Staking and rewards\n\nLedger Live allows direct staking of several assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cosmos (ATOM), Polkadot (DOT), Tezos (XTZ), Near Protocol (NEAR), among others.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- The initial delegation for staking **is not taxable** (no swap)\n- Rewards received are **investment income**\n- Undelegation **is not taxable** if you recover the same asset\n- If you sell the rewards, the gain or loss is calculated from their value when received\n\n### 4. Swaps through Ledger Live\n\nLedger Live integrates swap services that allow you to exchange cryptocurrencies directly within the app, working with providers such as Changelly, 1inch, or Paraswap.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\n- Each swap is a **taxable exchange** that generates a gain or loss\n- Even swapping BTC for ETH is taxable\n- Swap fees are deductible expenses\n- It is crucial to [correctly classify each type of operation](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas) to avoid mistakes\n\n### 5. DeFi operations via Ledger Connect\n\nIf you have connected your Ledger to DeFi protocols via WalletConnect or Ledger Connect, you may have performed operations including DEX swaps like Uniswap, liquidity provision, lending and borrowing, and NFT minting or trading.\n\n**Tax implications:**\n\nThese operations have the same treatment as if you had performed them from any other wallet. The difference is that they may not appear fully in the Ledger Live export, so you will need to supplement with data from the relevant blockchain explorer.\n\nIf you frequently operate with DeFi, we recommend reviewing our [guide to the taxation of DEXs and protocols like Uniswap](/blog/fiscalidad-dex-protocolos-uniswap-impuestos) to understand all the implications.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step guide: exporting from Ledger Live\n\nLet’s move on to the concrete process. Ledger Live offers a history export function, although it has some limitations you should be aware of.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, make sure you have:\n\n- Ledger Live updated to the latest version (always download from ledger.com)\n- All your accounts synchronized and up to date\n- Your Ledger device connected (optional but recommended for verification)\n- Storage space for CSV files\n- A spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets) to process the data\n\n### Step 1: Update and synchronize Ledger Live\n\n1. Open Ledger Live on your computer\n2. If an update is available, install it\n3. Wait for all your accounts to synchronize\n4. Verify that the displayed balance matches your expectations\n\n**Important:** An incomplete synchronization can result in an incomplete exported history. If you notice missing recent operations, force a resynchronization from each account’s settings.\n\n### Step 2: Access the export function\n\n1. In Ledger Live, go to **Settings** (gear icon in the top right)\n2. Select the **\"Accounts\"** tab\n3. Look for the **\"Export operation history\"** option\n4. You can also access it from the **File → Export operations** menu\n\n### Step 3: Configure the export\n\nLedger Live allows you to choose:\n\n- **Accounts to export:** All or selected accounts\n- **Date range:** Full history or a specific period\n- **Format:** CSV (the most useful for tax processing)\n\n**Recommendation:** For tax filing, export all accounts and the full year you need to declare (for example, 01/01/2024 to 31/12/2024).\n\n### Step 4: Download and verify the file\n\n1. Click **\"Export\"**\n2. Choose the location to save the file\n3. Save it with a descriptive name: `Ledger_History_2024.csv`\n4. Open the file to verify that it contains data\n\n### Step 5: Export by individual account (alternative)\n\nIf you prefer more granular control:\n\n1. Go to **Portfolio** in Ledger Live\n2. Select a specific account (e.g., \"Bitcoin\")\n3. In the account view, look for the download or \"Export\" icon\n4. Download the CSV for that account\n5. Repeat for each account\n\nThis method allows you to have separate files by cryptocurrency, which makes organization and review easier.\n\n---\n\n## Structure of the Ledger Live exported CSV\n\nOnce the file is downloaded, you need to understand its structure in order to process it correctly.\n\n### Typical columns in the Ledger Live CSV\n\n| Column | Description | Tax use |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Operation Date** | Date and time of the operation | Determine tax year |\n| **Currency Ticker** | Cryptocurrency symbol (BTC, ETH...) | Identify asset |\n| **Operation Type** | Type: IN, OUT, STAKE, UNSTAKE, REWARD... | Tax classification |\n| **Operation Amount** | Amount of crypto moved | Calculation base |\n| **Operation Fees** | Fees paid in the operation | Deductible expense |\n| **Operation Hash** | Blockchain transaction hash | Verification and traceability |\n| **Account Name** | Account name in Ledger Live | Organization |\n| **Account xpub** | Extended public key of the account | Unique identification |\n| **Countervalue Ticker** | Fiat currency (EUR, USD) | Valuation |\n| **Countervalue at Operation Date** | Fiat value at the time of operation | Gain calculation |\n| **Countervalue at CSV Export** | Fiat value at export time | Current reference |\n\n### Interpreting operation types\n\nLedger Live uses different labels for operation types:\n\n| Operation Type | Meaning | Tax treatment |\n|---|---|---|\n| **IN** | Incoming crypto | Depends on origin |\n| **OUT** | Outgoing crypto | Depends on destination |\n| **STAKE** | Delegation for staking | Not taxable (deposit) |\n| **UNSTAKE** | Withdrawal from staking | Not taxable (recovery) |\n| **REWARD** | Staking reward received | Investment income |\n| **SWAP** | Exchange between cryptos | Capital gain/loss |\n| **FEES** | Network fees paid | Deductible expense |\n\n### Information that may be missing from the export\n\nThe Ledger Live CSV has some **important limitations**:\n\n- **Original purchase price:** If you transferred crypto from an exchange, Ledger Live does not know the price you paid\n- **Complex DeFi operations:** Smart contract interactions via WalletConnect may not be fully reflected\n- **Multiple derived addresses:** Some accounts (especially Bitcoin) generate multiple addresses that can complicate tracking\n\n---\n\n## Supplementing the Ledger Live export\n\nTo have a complete tax history, you will likely need to supplement Ledger Live data with other sources.\n\n### Blockchain explorers\n\nFor each blockchain where you hold assets, you can consult the corresponding explorer:\n\n| Blockchain | Explorer | URL |\n|---|---|---|\n| Bitcoin | Blockstream | blockstream.info |\n| Ethereum | Etherscan | etherscan.io |\n| Polygon | Polygonscan | polygonscan.com |\n| Solana | Solscan | solscan.io |\n| Cosmos | Mintscan | mintscan.io |\n| Polkadot | Subscan | polkadot.subscan.io |\n| Cardano | Cardanoscan | cardanoscan.io |\n\n**How to obtain your public address:**\n\n1. In Ledger Live, select the account\n2. Click **\"Receive\"**\n3. Confirm on your Ledger device (recommended)\n4. Copy the displayed address\n5. Paste it into the corresponding explorer\n\nIf you need a more detailed guide on using explorers to supplement your history, our [Metamask export guide](/blog/como-exportar-historial-metamask) explains the process for Etherscan and other EVM-compatible explorers.\n\n### Exchange histories\n\nIf you transferred cryptocurrencies from exchanges to your Ledger, you need those histories to know the original acquisition price.\n\nFor example, if you bought 0.5 BTC on Binance at €25,000 and transferred it to your Ledger, you need the Binance record to know your acquisition cost was €12,500. Ledger Live will only see an incoming 0.5 BTC without price information.\n\nOur [complete guide to exporting Binance history](/blog/como-exportar-historial-binance-correctamente) explains exactly which sections to export and how to consolidate the data.\n\n### DeFi operation records\n\nIf you have used your Ledger with DeFi protocols via WalletConnect:\n\n1. Identify your Ledger addresses on each network\n2. Check each address in the corresponding explorer\n3. Export token operations and internal transactions\n4. Cross-reference the data with the Ledger Live export\n\n---\n\n## How to process the data for tax filing\n\nOnce all the data is exported, you need to process and structure it for your tax return.\n\n### Step 1: Consolidate all sources\n\nCreate a master spreadsheet that includes:\n\n- Ledger Live export\n- Blockchain explorer exports\n- Exchange histories where you originally purchased\n- Records of any DeFi operations\n\n### Step 2: Unify date formats\n\nLedger Live exports dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) in UTC. Make sure to:\n\n1. Convert all dates to the same format\n2. Adjust to Spanish time if necessary (UTC+1 in winter, UTC+2 in summer)\n3. Verify operations close to year-end (they may belong to a different tax year)\n\n### Step 3: Classify each operation\n\nEach operation must be classified into a tax category. This is where many users make mistakes that can be costly. Proper [operation classification](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas) is essential.\n\n**Main categories:**\n\n| Category | Examples | Taxation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Internal movement** | Ledger ↔ Your exchange | Not taxable |\n| **Fiat purchase** | EUR → BTC | Not taxable (acquisition) |\n| **Fiat sale** | BTC → EUR | Capital gain |\n| **Crypto swap** | BTC → ETH | Capital gain |\n| **Staking reward** | Receiving SOL from staking | Investment income |\n| **Airdrop** | Receiving free tokens | Investment income |\n| **Gas/fees paid** | Network fees | Deductible expense |\n\n### Step 4: Establish acquisition cost (for FIFO)\n\nTo calculate gains using the FIFO method, you need to know the acquisition cost of each unit:\n\n**Practical example:**\n\n1. **01/03/2024:** You buy 0.1 BTC at €40,000/BTC on Binance = €4,000\n2. **15/03/2024:** You transfer 0.1 BTC from Binance to Ledger (cost: €4,000)\n3. **01/06/2024:** You buy 0.05 BTC at €60,000/BTC on Kraken = €3,000\n4. **10/06/2024:** You transfer 0.05 BTC from Kraken to Ledger (cost: €3,000)\n5. **Total in Ledger:** 0.15 BTC with a weighted average cost of €46,667/BTC\n\n**If you sell 0.08 BTC on 01/09/2024 at €55,000/BTC:**\n\n- Sale price: 0.08 × €55,000 = €4,400\n- FIFO cost: 0.08 × €40,000 = €3,200 (first purchased)\n- **Capital gain:** €1,200\n\n### Step 5: Calculate investment income\n\nFor staking rewards:\n\n1. Identify each reward received in the CSV (REWARD type)\n2. Find the market price of the token at that exact moment\n3. Calculate the EUR value: amount × price\n4. Sum all returns for the year\n\n**Example:**\n\n- 15/04/2024: You receive 0.5 SOL from staking (SOL at €120) = €60\n- 15/05/2024: You receive 0.5 SOL from staking (SOL at €150) = €75\n- 15/06/2024: You receive 0.5 SOL from staking (SOL at €140) = €70\n- **Total Q2 returns:** €205\n\n### Step 6: Document deductible expenses\n\nNetwork fees (gas fees, transaction fees) are deductible expenses:\n\n- Add up all fees paid in EUR\n- Group by operation type if necessary\n- Fees from exempt operations (internal movements) are not deductible from gains\n\n---\n\n## Special cases with Ledger\n\n### Multiple accounts of the same asset\n\nLedger Live allows you to create multiple accounts for the same cryptocurrency (for example, several Bitcoin accounts). This is useful for organizing funds but complicates FIFO calculation.\n\n**Tax treatment:**\n\nThe AEAT considers all your cryptocurrencies of the same type together, regardless of which account they are in. FIFO applies to the total.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nIf you have multiple accounts, consolidate the entire history into a single chronologically ordered spreadsheet before applying FIFO.\n\n### Firmware updates and missing history\n\nSome users report that after updating Ledger firmware or reinstalling Ledger Live, the history appears incomplete.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- The history is on the blockchain, not on the device or the app\n- Fully resynchronize each account\n- If older operations are missing, use blockchain explorers as a backup\n- Always save copies of your CSV exports before updating\n\n### Ledger Recover and tax considerations\n\nLedger Recover is an optional seed phrase recovery service. From a tax perspective, using or not using this service does not change your obligations: the cryptocurrencies remain on the blockchain and are still considered abroad for model 721 purposes.\n\n### Migration from another device\n\nIf you migrated from an older Ledger Nano S to a Nano X or Stax, or from another hardware wallet brand:\n\n- The addresses are the same if you used the same seed phrase\n- The full history remains on the blockchain\n- Ledger Live will display the history when adding the accounts\n- There is no tax implication from the physical migration of the device\n\n---\n\n## Common mistakes when exporting Ledger data (and how to avoid them)\n\nBased on our experience processing hundreds of wallets, these are the most common errors.\n\n### Mistake 1: Assuming Ledger Live contains the full history\n\nIf you have used DeFi by connecting your Ledger to dApps, those operations may not appear fully in the Ledger Live export.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Identify all networks you have used\n- Check your addresses in the corresponding explorers\n- Cross-reference the data with the Ledger Live export\n- Document any discrepancies\n\n### Mistake 2: Not considering the origin of cryptocurrencies\n\nLedger Live records incoming transactions but does not know the purchase price if you acquired crypto elsewhere.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Keep records of all your original purchases\n- Link each Ledger deposit to its corresponding purchase\n- Retain exchange histories even after transferring\n\n### Mistake 3: Confusing staking with savings without returns\n\nSome users believe staking is like “having money in the bank” and is not taxable. Wrong: staking rewards are investment income.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Identify all rewards received (REWARD type in the CSV)\n- Value them at the market price at the time of receipt\n- Declare them as investment income\n\n### Mistake 4: Ignoring swap operations\n\nSwaps performed within Ledger Live are taxable exchanges that generate a gain or loss, even if you never converted to euros.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Review all SWAP-type operations\n- Calculate the gain or loss for each\n- Include them in your capital gains declaration\n\n### Mistake 5: Not saving transaction hashes\n\nThe transaction hash is irrefutable proof on the blockchain. Without it, it can be difficult to demonstrate details to the tax authority.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- The Ledger Live CSV includes hashes; keep it\n- You can verify any operation by pasting the hash into the explorer\n- Keep these records for at least 4 years (preferably 6)\n\n### Mistake 6: Not filing model 721 because you use a hardware wallet\n\nThe most dangerous mistake. Some users believe that because their crypto is “at home” on their Ledger, they do not need to file model 721.\n\n**Reality:**\n\nCryptocurrencies are on the blockchain, not on the device. They are considered abroad. If they exceed €50,000 as of December 31, you must file model 721. Penalties for not filing are severe, as we explain in our guide on [mistakes when declaring cryptocurrencies](/blog/errores-declarar-criptomonedas).\n\n---\n\n## Preparing the final tax report\n\nOnce all data is processed, structure a clear report for your tax filing.\n\n### Recommended report structure\n\n**1. Executive summary:**\n\n- Tax period: 01/01/2024 - 31/12/2024\n- Devices: Ledger Nano X (or the one you use)\n- Accounts analyzed: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.\n- Total operations: XXX transactions\n\n**2.
