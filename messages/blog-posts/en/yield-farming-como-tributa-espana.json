  "content": "Yield farming has become one of the most popular strategies for generating passive returns in the DeFi ecosystem. You deposit liquidity into a protocol, receive reward tokens, and —if all goes well— your assets grow. However, from a Spanish tax perspective, every step in this process has tax implications that most investors either don’t know about or underestimate.\n\n> **Initial warning:** The AEAT has not published specific doctrine on yield farming, but there are clear criteria on income, swaps, and capital gains that apply directly. Failing to report correctly can result in penalties of 50% to 150% of the underpaid tax, plus late-payment interest.\n\nThis article breaks down, with practical examples and real calculations, exactly how each component of yield farming is taxed: from the initial deposit to the final sale of rewards, including impermanent loss and the multiple layers of intermediary tokens that characterize these strategies.\n\n---\n\n## What yield farming is and why it creates tax obligations\n\n**Yield farming** (or \"farming\" for returns) is a DeFi strategy that consists of depositing cryptoassets into decentralized protocols to generate rewards. Unlike traditional staking, farming usually involves multiple layers of operations: providing liquidity, receiving LP tokens, depositing those LPs into \"farms\" to receive incentive tokens, and frequently automatic reinvestment (auto-compounding).\n\n**Typical components of a farming strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial deposit**: You contribute one or more tokens to a liquidity pool\n2. **Receiving LP tokens**: The protocol issues tokens that represent your share\n3. **Staking LP tokens**: You deposit those LPs into a \"farm\" to receive additional rewards\n4. **Rewards**: You receive protocol tokens (UNI, CAKE, CRV, etc.) as incentives\n5. **Claim/Harvest**: You periodically claim accumulated rewards\n6. **Sell or reinvest**: You sell the rewards or reinvest them to compound returns\n\nEach of these steps has specific tax consequences in Spain. The problem is that many investors only consider the final conversion to euros, ignoring the multiple intermediate taxable events.\n\n---\n\n## Key tax facts about yield farming in Spain\n\n| Concept | Tax treatment | Tax base | Tax rate |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Deposit into pool (swap)** | Capital gain | Market value of tokens delivered vs acquisition cost | 19%-28% |\n| **Rewards received (claim)** | Investment income | Market value in EUR of the token when received | 19%-28% |\n| **Sale of rewards** | Capital gain | Sale price - acquisition value (at claim time) | 19%-28% |\n| **Auto-compounding** | Each reinvestment creates a taxable event | Value of the reward at reinvestment time | 19%-28% |\n| **Impermanent loss** | Not deductible until withdrawal | Materializes when liquidity is withdrawn | - |\n| **Liquidity withdrawal** | Capital gain (transfer of LP) | Value recovered - acquisition value of LP | 19%-28% |\n\n**IRPF savings tax brackets 2025:**\n- Up to €6,000: 19%\n- €6,000 - €50,000: 21%\n- €50,000 - €200,000: 23%\n- €200,000 - €300,000: 27%\n- Over €300,000: 28%\n\n---\n\n## How yield farming rewards are taxed\n\nThe tokens you receive as a reward for farming have a specific tax treatment that many investors misunderstand.\n\n### Tax classification: investment income\n\nFarming rewards are considered **investment income**, not capital gains. This distinction is crucial because:\n\n1. **They are taxed when you receive them**, not when you sell them\n2. **The value to report** is the market price in EUR at the exact moment of the claim\n3. **FIFO does not apply** to determine the income (the value is already defined)\n4. **They set a new acquisition cost** for future sales\n\n**Why income and not capital gains?** The AEAT considers rewards to be compensation for lending your capital (liquidity) to the protocol, conceptually similar to interest from a bank deposit or stock dividends. They do not come from a disposal of assets, but from holding a productive position.\n\n### Practical example: CAKE farming on PancakeSwap\n\n```\nScenario:\n- You deposit BNB/BUSD liquidity into PancakeSwap\n- You receive LP tokens and stake them in the CAKE farm\n- During January you receive 50 CAKE as rewards\n- CAKE price at the time of claim: €3/CAKE\n\nTax calculation:\nInvestment income: 50 CAKE × €3 = €150\nTax (19% first bracket): €28.50\n\nAcquisition value for future sales:\n50 CAKE with a cost of €3/token = €150 total\n\nIf in March you sell those 50 CAKE at €5:\nCapital gain: (€5 - €3) × 50 = €100\nAdditional tax (19%): €19\n\nTotal taxes paid: €28.50 + €19 = €47.50\nNet profit after taxes: €150 + €100 - €47.50 = €202.50\n```\n\n### Multiple claims and aggregation\n\nIf you make multiple claims during the year (as is usual), each one generates independent income that you must record:\n\n```\nAnnual example:\n- January: claim 50 CAKE at €3 → €150 income\n- March: claim 30 CAKE at €4 → €120 income\n- June: claim 45 CAKE at €2.50 → €112.50 income\n- October: claim 60 CAKE at €3.20 → €192 income\n\nTotal annual income: €574.50\nBase tax (19%): €109.16\n\nCAKE inventory (for future FIFO):\n- 50 CAKE @ €3\n- 30 CAKE @ €4\n- 45 CAKE @ €2.50\n- 60 CAKE @ €3.20\n= 185 CAKE with weighted average cost: €3.10/CAKE\n```\n\n---\n\n## The auto-compounding problem: each reinvestment is taxed\n\nMany farming protocols and vaults offer auto-compounding: automatic reinvestment of rewards to maximize APY. From a tax perspective, this is a nightmare.\n\n### Why auto-compounding creates multiple taxable events\n\nEach time a vault reinvests your rewards automatically, the following tax events occur:\n\n1. **Receipt of the reward**: Investment income (even if you don’t \"see\" it in your wallet)\n2. **Swap of the reward into pool tokens**: Swap → Capital gain (usually €0 if instantaneous)\n3. **Deposit of the new tokens into the pool**: Another swap\n4. **Receipt of additional LP tokens**: New asset with a new acquisition cost\n\nIf the vault auto-compounds every hour (like Beefy Finance), you technically generate **24 taxable events per day** just from the reinvestment process.\n\n### Practical strategies to handle auto-compounding\n\n**Option 1: Simplified reporting (medium risk)**\nReport only the net increase in the vault value between entry and exit. You argue that auto-compounding does not create an effective gain because rewards are reinvested immediately. This interpretation is not validated by the AEAT but is the most practical.\n\n**Option 2: Strict reporting (conservative)**\nReconstruct each reinvestment as a separate taxable event. You will need specialized tools for [DeFi portfolio analysis](/servicios/analisis-carteras) to extract all contract events.\n\n**Option 3: Avoid auto-compound**\nUse protocols with manual claiming so you can control exactly when taxable events occur. Less efficient APY, but much simpler tax-wise.\n\n### Comparative example: manual vs auto-compound\n\n```\nInvestment: €10,000 in an ETH/USDC vault\nEstimated APY: 20% annually\nDuration: 1 year\n\nManual claim (monthly):\n- 12 claims of ~€166 each\n- 12 taxable income events\n- Total income: €2,000\n- Documentation: 12 records\n\nAuto-compound (hourly):\n- 8,760 reinvestments per year\n- Technically 8,760+ taxable events\n- Total reportable income: ~€2,000 (same)\n- Documentation: impossible manually\n\nPractical auto-compound solution:\n- Report net vault increase: €2,200 (includes compounding effect)\n- Argue as aggregated income\n- Risk: AEAT could request a detailed breakdown\n```\n\n---\n\n## Liquidity provision: the first taxable event many ignore\n\nBefore farming, you need LP tokens. And obtaining those LP tokens already creates tax obligations.\n\n### Initial deposit = swap\n\nWhen you deposit ETH + USDC into a Uniswap pool to receive LP tokens, you are executing a **swap**: you give two assets in exchange for a new one (the LP token). If ETH’s market value changed since you bought it, that difference is a capital gain.\n\n```\nExample:\nOriginal purchase: 1 ETH at €2,000 (January)\nDeposit into pool: 1 ETH + 2,500 USDC when ETH = €2,500 (March)\n\nTaxable event on deposit:\n- Transfer value of ETH: €2,500\n- Acquisition value of ETH: €2,000\n- Capital gain: €500\n\n- Transfer value of USDC: €2,500\n- Acquisition value of USDC: €2,500 (assuming 1:1)\n- Gain: €0\n\nTotal gain on deposit: €500\nTax (19%): €95\n\nNew asset:\nETH/USDC LP tokens with acquisition cost: €5,000\n```\n\n**Common mistake**: Not reporting this gain because you think you \"only moved crypto\". For the AEAT, receiving a different asset (LP token) in exchange for delivering others (ETH + USDC) is a disposal.\n\n### How it affects later farming\n\nThe acquisition cost of your LP tokens is the basis for calculating gains when you withdraw liquidity or sell positions. If you don’t record the initial value correctly, your future calculations will be wrong.\n\nFor a complete guide on how liquidity provision is taxed and its special cases, see our [guide on the taxation of DEX protocols](/blog/fiscalidad-dex-protocolos-uniswap-impuestos) where we analyze specific cases for Uniswap, Curve, and other AMMs.\n\n---\n\n## Impermanent loss in farming: when and how it matters for taxes\n\nImpermanent loss (IL) is the loss of value you suffer when providing liquidity and the price ratio between the two pool tokens changes. It is one of the most confusing concepts from a tax perspective.\n\n### Key rule: IL is not deductible while it remains in the pool\n\nWhile your funds remain in the pool, impermanent loss is an **unrealized loss**. The AEAT does not allow deducting potential losses—only losses materialized through an actual disposal of the asset.\n\n```\nExample:\nInitial deposit: 1 ETH (€3,000) + 3,000 USDC = €6,000\n\nThree months later (ETH rises to €5,000):\n- If you had HODLed: 1 ETH (€5,000) + 3,000 USDC = €8,000\n- Current value in pool: ~€7,400 (due to IL)\n- Impermanent loss: €600\n\nCan you deduct that €600 loss?\nNO. The IL has not materialized.\n\nThe farming rewards you received ARE taxable.\nYou can be paying taxes on rewards while suffering IL.\n```\n\n### IL materializes when you withdraw liquidity\n\nImpermanent loss becomes a real tax loss only when you withdraw liquidity. At that moment, you compare:\n\n- **Value of what you recover** (tokens you receive when burning LP)\n- **Acquisition value of the LP tokens** (what you paid when depositing)\n\n```\nContinuation of the example:\nYou withdraw liquidity:\n- You burn LP tokens (acquisition cost: €6,000)\n- You receive: 0.8 ETH (€4,000) + 4,000 USDC\n- Value recovered: €8,000\n\nTax calculation:\nCapital gain: €8,000 - €6,000 = €2,000\n\nWhere is the IL?\nThe IL is \"absorbed\" in the calculation. You recovered €8,000 instead of\nthe €10,000 you would have had if you had HODLed, but tax-wise\nonly the €2,000 gain versus your original investment matters.\n\nIf the pool had gone badly and you recovered only €5,000:\nCapital loss: €5,000 - €6,000 = -€1,000\nThis loss IS deductible and offsets other gains.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Types of farming and their tax specifics\n\nNot all yield farming is the same. Each type has specific tax nuances.\n\n### 1. Liquidity mining on DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Curve)\n\n**Mechanism**: You provide liquidity to an AMM and receive LP tokens + protocol rewards.\n\n**Taxation**:\n- Deposit: Swap → Potential capital gain\n- Accumulated trading fees: Income embedded in the LP token value\n- Rewards (UNI, CAKE, CRV): Investment income at claim\n- Withdrawal: Capital gain/loss on LP tokens\n\n**Curve Finance example:**\n```\nYou deposit 10,000 USDC into the 3pool (USDC/DAI/USDT)\nYou receive: 10,000 3CRV tokens\n\nNo initial gain (stablecoins do not fluctuate)\n\nYou stake the 3CRV in the Curve gauge:\nYou receive: 50 CRV weekly @ €0.50 = €25/week\nMonthly income: ~€100\n\nAnnual: €1,200 in CRV rewards\nTax (19%): €228\n\nWhen withdrawing, if the pool grew from fees:\nYou recover 10,500 USDC equivalent\nGain: €500 (from accumulated fees)\nTax: €95\n```\n\n### 2. Leveraged farming (Alpaca Finance, Francium)\n\n**Mechanism**: You borrow funds to multiply your farming position.\n\n**Special tax treatment**:\n- **Loan received**: Not taxable (not income)\n- **Interest paid**: NOT deductible in IRPF for individuals\n- **Liquidation**: Capital loss if you lose collateral\n- **Amplified rewards**: Taxed the same way, but larger amounts\n\n```\nExample leveraged farming:\nCollateral: 1,000 USDC\nLeverage: 3x\nTotal position: 3,000 USDC in the pool\n\nAnnual rewards (assuming 20% APY):\n- Without leverage: 200 USDC → €38 tax\n- With 3x: 600 USDC → €114 tax\n\nBut if there is severe IL + a price drop:\n- Collateral liquidation\n- Loss: 1,000 USDC\n- Deductible against other gains\n```\n\n**Tax risk**: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses, but taxes are paid on gross gains while losses only offset if they are in the same year or the next 4 years.\n\n### 3. Liquid staking + DeFi (Lido + farming)\n\n**Mechanism**: You stake ETH in Lido, receive stETH, and use that stETH for additional farming.\n\n**Tax layers**:\n\n```\nLayer 1: Staking in Lido\n- You deposit 10 ETH at €3,000 = €30,000\n- You receive 10 stETH\n- SWAP: If ETH changed in price, there is a gain\n- Acquisition cost of stETH: €30,000\n\nLayer 2: Accumulation of staking rewards\n- stETH appreciates relative to ETH (rebasing)\n- Increase of ~4% annually\n- INCOME: 0.4 stETH × €3,000 = €1,200 annually\n- Taxed as investment income\n\nLayer 3: Farming with stETH (e.g., Curve stETH/ETH)\n- You deposit stETH into the pool\n- Another SWAP: stETH → LP token\n- Additional rewards in CRV/LDO\n- More INCOME to report\n\nLayer 4: Final withdrawal\n- You burn LP, recover stETH\n- You unstake stETH → ETH\n- You sell ETH → EUR\n- Final CAPITAL GAIN\n```\n\nThese layered strategies require [specialized DeFi portfolio tracking](/servicios/seguimiento-cartera) so you don’t miss any tax events.\n\n### 4. Yield aggregators (Yearn, Beefy, Convex)\n\n**Mechanism**: You deposit into a vault that automatically optimizes farming strategies.\n\n**Special feature**: The vault manages everything internally, but tax-wise each internal operation is yours.\n\n```\nYearn USDC vault example:\nYou deposit 10,000 USDC\nYou receive yvUSDC (vault token)\n\nInternally, the vault:\n- Deposits into Aave → generates aUSDC + rewards\n- Moves to Compound → generates cUSDC + COMP\n- Sells COMP → more USDC\n- Re-deposits\n\nEach internal operation is technically taxable,\nbut you only see: you deposited 10,000, you withdrew 10,800.\n\nPractical approach:\n- Report €800 as vault income\n- Document deposit and withdrawal hashes\n- Risk: AEAT could request an internal breakdown\n```\n\n---\n\n## Full yield farming case studies\n\n### Case 1: Conservative farmer on Curve\n\n**Profile**: Investor seeking stable yield in stablecoins.\n\n**2024 operations**:\n1.

March: Deposits 2,000 USDC as collateral in Alpaca Finance\n2. March: Opens a 3x position in an ETH/USDC pool (6,000 USDC exposure)\n3. April: ETH drops 30%, position partially liquidated\n4. April: Remaining collateral 800 USDC + 100 ALPACA rewards\n5. May: Closes position, recovers 750 USDC + 100 ALPACA\n\n**Tax calculation**:\n\n```\nOpening the position (March):\n- Collateral deposited: 2,000 USDC\n- Loan received: 4,000 USDC (not taxable)\n- Swap into LP: technically a taxable event\n- But with no price variation: €0 gain\n\nDuring farming:\n- Rewards 100 ALPACA @ €0.30 = €30\n- Investment income: €30\n\nPartial liquidation (April):\n- Loss of 1,200 USDC from collateral\n- This loss materializes: -€1,200\n\nFinal close (May):\n- Recovers 750 USDC\n- Additional loss: 800 - 750 = 50 USDC\n\nSUMMARY:\n- ALPACA income: €30 → Tax €5.70\n- Collateral loss: 2,000 - 750 = €1,250\n\nNet tax effect:\n- Capital loss: €1,250\n- Income: €30\n\nThe €1,250 loss offsets other capital gains in the year.\nIf there are not enough gains, it carries forward 4 years.\n\nNote: The 4,000 USDC loan was repaid through\nliquidation; there is no outstanding debt or taxable event.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Modelo 721 and farming: do I need to report my DeFi positions?\n\nIf your farming positions exceed €50,000 on December 31, you must file **Modelo 721** to report cryptocurrencies held abroad.\n\n### What to include in Modelo 721\n\n```\nFarming positions to consider:\n✓ LP tokens in liquidity pools\n✓ LP tokens staked in farms\n✓ Unclaimed rewards (even if you haven’t claimed them)\n✓ Positions in yield aggregator vaults\n✓ Collateral deposited in lending protocols\n✓ Staked tokens (stETH, rETH, etc.)\n\nHow to value:\n- LP tokens: market value of the underlying (not the \"number\" of LPs)\n- Unclaimed rewards: EUR value at valuation time (Dec 31)\n- Vaults: vault token value × price\n```\n\n**Example 721 calculation:**\n```\nPositions as of December 31:\n- 500 UNI-V2 ETH/USDC (equivalent to 3 ETH + 10,000 USDC)\n  → 3 × €3,500 + €10,000 = €20,500\n\n- 10,000 yvUSDC in Yearn\n  → €10,500 (vault grew 5%)\n\n- 200 CRV pending claim\n  → 200 × €0.60 = €120\n\n- 5 stETH in Lido\n  → 5 × €3,500 = €17,500\n\nTOTAL: €48,620 → Does NOT exceed €50,000, Modelo 721 not mandatory\n\nIf ETH had been at €3,800:\n- LP: €11,400 + €10,000 = €21,400\n- stETH: €19,000\n- Total: €51,020 → Modelo 721 IS mandatory\n```\n\nFor a detailed guide on Modelo 721 and how it affects your DeFi positions, see our [guide on Modelo 721 and cryptocurrencies](/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas).\n\n---\n\n## Common mistakes when reporting farming\n\nThese are the most common mistakes we see in [farming portfolio analysis](/servicios/analisis-carteras):\n\n### Mistake 1: \"Rewards aren’t taxed until I sell them\"\n\n**Incorrect.** Rewards are taxed as investment income at the time of claim, at the market value in EUR at that moment. The later sale creates an additional capital gain/loss.\n\n**Consequence:** Unreported income for years. 50-150% penalty + interest.\n\n### Mistake 2: \"Impermanent loss gives me losses I can deduct\"\n\n**Incorrect.** IL is only deductible when you withdraw liquidity and materialize the loss. While it remains in the pool, it is an unrealized loss and not deductible.\n\n**Consequence:** Reporting unrealized losses. The AEAT can reject them and apply a penalty.\n\n### Mistake 3: \"I use the same acquisition cost for all my rewards\"\n\n**Incorrect.** Each claim has its own acquisition value (token price at that moment). When selling, you must apply FIFO using the chronological order of claims.\n\n**Consequence:** Incorrect gain calculations that may benefit you or hurt you.\n\n### Mistake 4: \"Auto-compounding doesn’t create taxable events\"\n\n**Debatable.** Technically each reinvestment is a tax event. In practice, many report only the net result, but there is no AEAT doctrine supporting it.\n\n**Consequence:** Risk of an information request demanding a detailed breakdown.\n\n### Mistake 5: \"I don’t report because nobody knows what I do in DeFi\"\n\n**Incorrect.** With DAC8 (from 2026), exchanges will automatically report all inflows and outflows. The AEAT will be able to infer your DeFi activity from balance discrepancies. More details in our [guide on DAC8 and DeFi](/en/blog/dac8-defi-wallets-swaps-liquidez-fiscalidad).\n\n**Consequence:** Statute of limitations extended to 10 years if you don’t file Modelo 721, aggravated penalties for concealment.\n\n---\n\n## Tools for farming tracking\n\nTracking farming operations manually is almost impossible at high volume. These tools help:\n\n### For visualization\n\n- **DeBank**: Excellent for viewing positions across multiple chains\n- **Zapper**: Clear interface, good farm detection\n- **APY.Vision**: Specialized in tracking IL and farming performance\n\n### For tax export\n\n- **Rotki**: Open source, allows exporting operations\n- **CoinTracking**: Detects some basic DeFi operations\n- **Koinly**: Limited DeFi support but improving\n\n### For professional analysis\n\nIf you operate across multiple protocols, chains, and complex strategies, automated tools have significant limitations. The [professional DeFi portfolio analysis](/servicios/analisis-carteras) combines technical tools with expert review to:\n\n- Detect operations that automated trackers miss\n- Classify correctly under Spanish AEAT criteria\n- Value illiquid or exotic positions\n- Handle auto-compounding, leverage, and liquidations\n\nYou can see more options in our [comparison of tools to track cryptocurrencies](/blog/herramientas-rastrear-criptomonedas).\n\n---\n\n## FAQ: Yield farming taxation in Spain\n\n### Are farming rewards taxed as income or capital gains?\n\n**As investment income.** The tokens you receive as farming rewards (UNI, CAKE, CRV, etc.) are taxed at their market value in EUR at the time of claim. It is similar to receiving dividends or interest.\n\n### When are rewards taxed: when I receive them or when I sell them?\n\n**When you receive them (claim).** The taxable event occurs when you claim rewards, not when you sell them. The later sale creates an additional capital gain/loss if the price changed since the claim.\n\n### Can I deduct impermanent loss from my taxes?\n\n**Only when you withdraw liquidity.** Impermanent loss is unrealized while your funds are in the pool. It materializes as a deductible capital loss only when you burn your LP tokens and recover the underlying assets at a lower value than what you deposited.\n\n### How do I report if I use auto-compounding vaults?\n\n**There are two approaches.** The conservative approach reports each reinvestment as a separate event (very complex). The practical approach reports the net increase of the vault as aggregated income. The AEAT has no specific doctrine, so document your methodology well.\n\n### Does depositing into a liquidity pool create taxes?\n\n**It can.** Depositing tokens into a pool is a swap (you deliver ETH+USDC, you receive LP tokens). If the market value of the tokens you deliver differs from their acquisition cost, there is a capital gain. This typically happens when the token price changed since you bought it.\n\n### Do I have to report farming if I never converted to euros?\n\n**Yes.** Rewards are taxed when received, regardless of whether you sold them for EUR. Swaps and exchanges in DeFi also create taxable events without needing to \"cash out\" to fiat.\n\n### How do I apply FIFO if I made multiple claims of the same token?\n\n**Each claim establishes a lot.** If you made 12 CRV claims during the year at different prices, you have 12 lots with different acquisition costs. When selling, you assign sales to the oldest lots first (FIFO).\n\n### What if the farming protocol was hacked and I lost funds?\n\n**It is a deductible capital loss.** If you can prove you had funds in the protocol and that the hack caused the loss (via transaction hashes and incident documentation), you can report the loss. It offsets other capital gains in the same year or the next 4 years.\n\n### Do I need to file Modelo 721 because of my farming positions?\n\n**If they exceed €50,000 on December 31, yes.** Sum the market value of all your LP tokens, vault positions, unclaimed rewards, and staked tokens. If the total exceeds €50,000, you must file Modelo 721 before March 31.\n\n### Are interest payments on leveraged loans deductible?\n\n**Not for individuals.** Under IRPF, interest on loans for personal investment is not deductible from the income or gains obtained. If you operate as an economic activity (company/self-employed), the treatment may differ.\n\n### How do I document my farming operations for the tax authorities?\n\n**Keep transaction hashes.** Each deposit, claim, withdrawal, and swap has a unique on-chain hash that serves as your documentary proof. Complement it with explorer screenshots (Etherscan, BSCScan) showing amounts and dates. For complex portfolios, consider using [professional analysis services](/servicios/analisis-carteras) that generate auditable reports.\n\n### What if I didn’t report farming in previous years?\n\n**You have regularization options.** If the filing deadline hasn’t closed, file an amended return. If it has closed but there is no request, file a voluntary late return (lower surcharges). If there is already a request, penalties will be higher. The sooner you regularize, the less you will pay. See our guide on [crypto tax filing mistakes](/blog/errores-declarar-criptomonedas) for more details.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: profitable farming requires tax planning\n\nYield farming can generate attractive returns, but the tax complexity is significant. Each claim, each deposit, each withdrawal has tax consequences that, if ignored, can turn a profitable strategy into a problem with the tax authorities.\n\n**Keys to tax-efficient farming:**\n\n1. **Document from day one**: Hash of every transaction, EUR price at each moment\n2. **Separate income from gains**: Rewards are income at claim, sales are capital gains\n3. **Don’t ignore the initial deposit**: The swap into LP tokens can generate a gain\n4. **IL is not deductible in the pool**: Only when withdrawing do you materialize the loss\n5. **Be careful with auto-compound**: Choose your reporting approach and stick to it\n6. **Check Modelo 721**: If you exceed €50,000 in DeFi positions, it is mandatory\n7. **Plan for DAC8**: In 2-3 years, DeFi opacity will be history\n\n**Recommended next steps:**\n\n- **If you farm actively**: Implement systematic tracking or hire [professional portfolio tracking](/servicios/seguimiento-cartera)\n- **If you have doubts about past filings**: Request a [portfolio analysis](/servicios/analisis-carteras) to assess pending obligations\n- **If you need certified tax calculations**: Our [tax settlement service](/servicios/liquidaciones-fiscales) prepares the forms ready to file\n- **For ongoing advisory**: [Specialized crypto tax advisory](/servicios/asesoria-fiscal-criptomonedas) supports you throughout the year\n\nReporting correctly not only avoids penalties: it lets you legally optimize your tax burden and sleep well knowing you comply with the rules.\n\n---\n\n## Need help with the taxation of your farming?\n\nAt Cleriontax we specialize in advanced DeFi taxation.
