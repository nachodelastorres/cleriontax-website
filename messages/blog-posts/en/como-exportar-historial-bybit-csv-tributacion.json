  "content": "**Bybit** has become one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, especially among traders looking to operate with derivatives, perpetual futures and leverage. Its intuitive interface, low commissions and wide variety of products have attracted thousands of Spanish users in recent years.\n\nBut when it comes time to prepare the **tax return** and you need to justify your operations to the AEAT, many Bybit users find themselves facing an unexpected problem: how do you correctly export all the data from an exchange that offers so many different products?\n\nBybit is not a simple exchange. It combines spot trading, perpetual futures, options, copy trading, earn and launchpad in a single platform. Each of these products generates different tax data, and not all are exported from the same place. Without a systematic process, it's very easy to leave operations out of your declaration.\n\nExporting your Bybit data incorrectly or incompletely can result in:\n\n- Erroneous tax returns leading to penalties from the tax authority\n- Inability to justify the origin of your gains or losses\n- Incorrect calculations of the mandatory FIFO method in Spain\n- Omission of returns from staking, airdrops or rewards\n- Lack of traceability in case of a possible AEAT requirement\n\nIn this **complete and updated guide**, we will teach you step by step how to export all your Bybit data in CSV format, what information each file contains, how to interpret it correctly and how to organize it for your tax return.\n\n---\n\n## Why Bybit Requires Special Attention in Data Export\n\n### The Complexity of Bybit Compared to Other Exchanges\n\nBybit presents unique characteristics that differentiate it from more traditional exchanges like Binance or Kraken. While on Kraken most users operate exclusively in spot with [direct euro pairs](/en/blog/como-obtener-csv-kraken-tributacion), Bybit attracts a user profile more oriented towards active trading with derivatives.\n\nThis difference has direct tax implications. Perpetual futures operations, for example, don't work the same as a spot buy-sell. In a perpetual future, you don't actually acquire the underlying cryptocurrency, but rather you're speculating on its price. This means that the tax treatment may vary depending on your interpretation of the regulations.\n\nAdditionally, Bybit offers products that generate passive returns (Bybit Earn, Launchpool, staking) which must be declared as investment income, not as capital gains. Mixing these concepts is one of the [most common mistakes when declaring cryptocurrencies](/en/blog/errores-declarar-criptomonedas).\n\n### Tax Obligations with Cryptocurrencies in Spain\n\nAs a Bybit user in Spain, your tax obligations depend on the type of operations you have performed.\n\nIf you have operated in the spot market buying and selling cryptocurrencies, each sale generates a capital gain or loss that must be declared in the [form 100 using the FIFO method](/en/blog/como-declarar-criptomonedas-renta-2025). These gains are taxed in the savings base with rates ranging from 19% to 28% depending on the volume.\n\nIf the total value of your cryptocurrencies on Bybit and other foreign exchanges exceeds 50,000 euros as of December 31, you are required to file [form 721 for declaration of crypto-assets abroad](/en/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas). Penalties for non-compliance can range from 1,500 euros to 150% of the undeclared value.\n\nReturns obtained from staking, savings or participation in launchpools must be declared as investment income in the tax year they are received. It doesn't matter if you haven't converted them to euros: the tax obligation arises at the time of receiving the reward.\n\nFinally, with the entry into force of the [DAC8 Directive](/en/blog/directiva-dac8-criptomonedas-exchanges-hacienda), exchanges are required to report user information to tax authorities. Bybit, although headquartered in Dubai, operates with entities in Europe that are subject to these information requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Data You Can Export from Bybit\n\nBybit organizes its products into different sections, and each has its own export system. Before starting the process, it's important to identify which products you have used to know exactly which files you need to export.\n\n### 1. Spot Trade History\n\nThe spot trade history includes all buy-sell operations you have performed in the Bybit spot market. Each operation records the exact date and time in UTC, the trading pair (for example BTC/USDT, ETH/EUR), the type of order executed, the price, the quantity and the commissions paid.\n\nThis file is fundamental for calculating your capital gains using the FIFO method. Each line represents a tax event that must be included in your declaration if you have sold or exchanged cryptocurrencies.\n\n### 2. Derivatives History (Futures and Perpetuals)\n\nIf you have operated with perpetual futures, expiring futures or options, you need to export the specific derivatives history. This data includes open and closed positions, entry and exit prices, liquidations (if any), funding fees (funding rates) and the realized PnL of each operation.\n\nThe tax treatment of derivatives can be complex. Although the majority doctrine considers that futures gains are taxed as capital gains, the lack of specific jurisprudence in Spain makes it advisable to consult with a professional if you have operated intensively with these products.\n\n### 3. Deposit and Withdrawal History\n\nThis file documents all fund movements in and out of your Bybit account. It includes cryptocurrency deposits from other wallets, bank transfers (if you used fiat), withdrawals to other addresses and internal transfers between Bybit products.\n\nDeposit and withdrawal information is crucial to demonstrate the traceability of your funds. If the tax authority requires you, this history is your evidence of the origin of the capital you used to operate.\n\n### 4. Conversion History\n\nBybit allows you to instantly convert between cryptocurrencies without going through the order book of the spot market. These conversions are recorded in a different section and many users forget to export them.\n\nFrom a tax perspective, each conversion between cryptocurrencies constitutes an exchange that generates a capital gain or loss. Converting Bitcoin to Ethereum is no different from selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum: both operations have the same tax impact according to the [AEAT operation classification](/en/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas).\n\n### 5. Bybit Earn History (Staking and Savings)\n\nIf you have participated in Bybit Earn products such as Savings, Launchpool or staking, each reward received constitutes investment income that must be declared.\n\nThe Earn file includes each individual reward with its date of receipt and quantity. However, Bybit does not provide the market price at the time of receipt, data that you will need to obtain separately to correctly value the return.\n\n### 6. Airdrop and Rewards History\n\nBybit distributes tokens through promotional airdrops, referral rewards, trading volume bonuses and other promotions. Each token received for free also has tax implications and must be valued at the market price on the day of receipt.\n\n### 7. Balances at Specific Date\n\nTo determine if you need to file form 721, you need to know the total value of your cryptocurrencies on Bybit as of December 31. Although Bybit does not offer a specific historical balance report, you can approximate this information by combining your current balance with the history of operations.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Export Data from Bybit\n\nNow let's see exactly how to export each type of data from your Bybit account. The process may seem lengthy, but it's important to follow it systematically so as not to leave operations out.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting the export, make sure you have full access to your Bybit account with identity verification (KYC) completed. You will need two-factor authentication enabled and a stable internet connection. Also prepare enough storage space to save multiple CSV files, and use an updated web browser to avoid compatibility problems.\n\n### Step 1: Export Spot Trade History\n\nTo export your spot market operations history, log in to the Bybit website and go to the \"Assets\" section. Look for the \"Spot\" option and access the completed order history (\"Order History\" or \"Trade History\").\n\nOnce in the history, configure the filters to select the period you need to export. Bybit allows you to export up to 3 months per file, so if you have operated throughout the year you will need to make multiple exports.\n\nSelect all trading pairs (\"All Pairs\") and make sure the order type is also set to \"All\". Click \"Export\" or \"Download\" and select the CSV format.\n\nThe resulting file will have columns such as:\n\n- **Order ID:** Unique order identifier\n- **Symbol:** Trading pair (BTCUSDT, ETHEUR, etc.)\n- **Side:** Buy or Sell\n- **Order Type:** Market, Limit, etc.\n- **Order Price:** Order price\n- **Filled:** Quantity executed\n- **Average Filled Price:** Average execution price\n- **Fee:** Commission paid\n- **Create Time:** Creation date and time (UTC)\n\n### Step 2: Export Derivatives History\n\nThe history of perpetual futures and other derivatives is exported from a different section. Go to \"Derivatives\" in the main menu and access \"Order History\" or \"Trade History\" within this section.\n\nHere you will find your perpetual futures operations (USDT Perpetual, Inverse Perpetual) and expiring futures if you have used them. The export process is similar: configure the period, select all contracts and export in CSV.\n\nThe derivatives file will include additional specific information such as the leverage used, the notional value of the position, the realized PnL, maker/taker commissions and funding fees paid or received.\n\nIf you have had partial or total liquidations, these will also appear in the history. It's important to export this data even if it represents losses, as capital losses can offset gains.\n\n### Step 3: Export Deposit and Withdrawal History\n\nFor fund movements, go to \"Assets\" and look for \"Transaction History\" or \"Asset History\". This section allows you to filter by type of operation.\n\nFirst export deposits (\"Deposit History\") selecting the complete period since you opened the account. The file will include the date, the cryptocurrency deposited, the amount, the source address and the transaction status.\n\nNext, export withdrawals (\"Withdrawal History\") following the same process. This file will show each withdrawal with its destination address, amount, network fee and status.\n\n### Step 4: Export Conversion History\n\nInstant conversions are usually in a separate section. Look for \"Convert\" in the Assets menu or in the trading section. Access the conversion history and export the complete period.\n\nIf you don't find a direct export option for conversions, you may need to manually copy the data or take screenshots. In any case, document each conversion with its date, source cryptocurrency, quantity, destination cryptocurrency and quantity received.\n\n### Step 5: Export Bybit Earn History\n\nFor yield products, go to \"Earn\" and access the rewards history. Bybit organizes these products into categories such as Flexible Savings, Fixed Savings, Launchpool and Staking.\n\nExport the history of each product you have used. The file will show each individual reward with its distribution date, the cryptocurrency received and the quantity.\n\nRemember that you will need the market price of each cryptocurrency on the date of receipt to correctly value these returns. You can obtain this information from sources such as CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap or Bybit's own price history.\n\n### Step 6: Document Balances as of December 31\n\nBybit does not offer a historical balance report, but you can reconstruct your position as of December 31 in several ways.\n\nThe simplest is to take a screenshot of your balances on December 31 itself. If that date has already passed, you can calculate the balance starting from your current position and subtracting or adding the operations performed since then.\n\nDocument each cryptocurrency you had, the exact quantity and the market price at year-end. This information is essential to determine if you exceed the 50,000 euro threshold that triggers the obligation to file form 721.\n\n---\n\n## How to Interpret the Data Exported from Bybit\n\nOnce the CSV files are downloaded, it's important to understand their structure to process them correctly.\n\n### Converting UTC Dates to Local Time\n\nBybit exports all dates in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). For Spain, you must add 1 hour in winter time and 2 hours in summer time.\n\nThis conversion is especially important for operations near year-end. An operation recorded in Bybit as December 31 at 23:30 UTC actually corresponds to January 1 at 00:30 in Spain during winter time. This means that fiscally it belongs to the following year.\n\n### Identification of Tax Events\n\nNot all lines in the CSVs represent events that generate taxation. It's important to know how to distinguish which operations have tax impact and which don't.\n\nTaxation is generated by sales of cryptocurrencies to fiat or stablecoins, exchanges between different cryptocurrencies (swaps), instant conversions, liquidations of derivative positions and each staking or earn reward received.\n\nImmediate taxation is not generated by purchases of cryptocurrencies with fiat, deposits to your Bybit account, withdrawals to other wallets of your own (they are internal transfers) or transfers between products within the same Bybit account.\n\n### Handling Derivatives: Tax Particularities\n\nPerpetual futures operations have specific characteristics that require attention. When you open a long or short position, you are not buying or selling the underlying cryptocurrency, but a derivative contract.\n\nThe PnL (Profit and Loss) that Bybit shows in your derivatives history is the net result of each closed operation. This profit or loss must be declared as capital gain or loss in the year in which it is realized.\n\nFunding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions to keep the perpetual price aligned with the spot. If you have paid funding, it's a cost associated with your operation. If you have received funding, it's additional income.\n\n### USDT Pairs: Conversion to Euros\n\nMost operations on Bybit are performed against USDT. For your tax return, you need to convert these values to euros using the exchange rate of each operation day.\n\nBybit does not automatically provide this conversion, so you will have to add a column in your spreadsheet with the USDT/EUR or USD/EUR exchange rate for each date. You can obtain this data from the European Central Bank, CoinGecko or other reliable sources of historical quotes.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Errors When Exporting Bybit Data\n\nBased on our experience processing data from hundreds of Bybit users, these are the most common mistakes you should avoid.\n\n### Error 1: Forgetting to Export Instant Conversions\n\nMany users export their spot trade history but completely forget the conversions made through Bybit's Convert function. These operations can represent a significant percentage of your activity and each one generates a tax event.\n\nSpecifically check if you have used the instant conversion function and export that history separately.\n\n### Error 2: Not Including Derivatives History\n\nIf you have operated with perpetual futures, the derivatives history is completely independent of the spot history. Many users incorrectly assume that by exporting \"everything\" from the Assets section they are also capturing derivatives.\n\nThe history of futures, perpetuals and options must be exported from the specific Derivatives section.\n\n### Error 3: Ignoring Funding Rates\n\nFunding rates from perpetual positions can add up to significant amounts over a year, especially if you hold positions open for long periods. These charges or payments have tax implications that you should not ignore.\n\n### Error 4: Not Documenting Earn Rewards\n\nBybit Earn rewards constitute investment income that must be declared even if you have not converted them to euros. Each token received must be valued at the market price on the day of receipt.\n\n### Error 5: Exporting Incomplete Periods\n\nBybit limits export to periods of 3 months. If you have operated throughout the fiscal year, you need to make at least 4 different exports and combine them. Many users export only one quarter thinking it's their entire history.\n\nAlways verify that the first record of your export matches your first operation on the platform.\n\n### Error 6: Not Converting UTC Dates Correctly\n\nAs mentioned earlier, not converting dates from UTC to local time can result in assigning operations to the wrong tax year. This error is especially serious for operations performed in the last days of December.\n\n---\n\n## How to Organize Exported Data\n\nOnce all necessary files have been downloaded, it's essential to organize them systematically to facilitate processing and have orderly documentation for possible requirements.\n\n### Recommended Folder Structure\n\nOrganize your files in a clear structure:\n\n```\nBybit_Tax_2024/\n├── 1_Original_Exports/\n│   ├── Bybit_Spot_2024_Q1.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Spot_2024_Q2.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Spot_2024_Q3.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Spot_2024_Q4.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Derivatives_2024.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Deposits_2024.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Withdrawals_2024.csv\n│   ├── Bybit_Convert_2024.csv\n│   └── Bybit_Earn_Rewards_2024.csv\n├── 2_Processed_Data/\n│   ├── Consolidated_All_Operations.xlsx\n│   ├── FIFO_Calculations.xlsx\n│   └── EUR_Conversion.xlsx\n├── 3_Evidence/\n│   ├── Screenshot_balances_31dec.png\n│   ├── Screenshots_export_process/\n│   └── Quotation_notes.txt\n└── 4_Final_Report/\n    └── Tax_Summary_Bybit_2024.xlsx\n```\n\nThis structure allows you to keep the original files unmodified, document your work process and have everything organized for audits.\n\n### Consolidation of Multiple Files\n\nIf you have exported several quarters of spot or derivatives data, you need to consolidate them into a single file to facilitate analysis.\n\nOpen the oldest file in Excel or Google Sheets. Copy the data rows (without headers) from more recent files and paste them at the end. Sort all rows by date to have a chronological record. Verify there are no duplicates or gaps in dates.\n\n### Calculation of Gains with FIFO Method\n\nSpain requires the FIFO (First In, First Out) method to calculate capital gains: the first cryptocurrencies you bought are the first considered sold.\n\nFor each sale, you need to identify which purchase lots correspond according to FIFO, calculate the proportional acquisition cost of those lots, subtract the acquisition cost from the sale price and the result is your capital gain or loss.\n\nThis calculation is enormously complicated if you operate with multiple exchanges and wallets, since FIFO must be applied globally, not per platform. If in addition to Bybit you use Binance, Kraken or other platforms, you need to consolidate all data before applying FIFO.\n\n### Use of Automation Tools\n\nFor users with high volume of operations, manually processing all data can be unfeasible. There are [specialized tools for tracking cryptocurrencies](/en/blog/herramientas-rastrear-criptomonedas) that can import Bybit data and automatically calculate gains.\n\nPlatforms like Koinly, CoinTracking or CryptoTax allow you to import CSV files or connect via API. However, these tools have important limitations for the Spanish market: they don't correctly apply the specific AEAT criteria, they can incorrectly classify DeFi or derivatives operations, and they don't directly generate Spanish tax forms.\n\nTherefore, even if you use these tools as a starting point, it's advisable to [clean and verify the data](/en/blog/limpiar-datasets-cripto-antes-declarar) before using them for your declaration.\n\n---\n\n## Verification of Data Integrity\n\nBefore using your exported data to prepare the tax return, you must exhaustively verify that it is complete and consistent.\n\n### Verification Checklist\n\nFirst check temporal completeness: the first record must match your first operation on Bybit and the last record must be recent. There should be no date gaps between consecutive exports.\n\nVerify balance consistency by adding up all deposits, subtracting all withdrawals, and adding or subtracting trading operations. The result should roughly match your current balance on Bybit (there may be small differences due to commissions or rounding).\n\nAlso check that all operations you remember having performed appear in the files. If you operated with derivatives, verify that you specifically exported that history. If you used Bybit Earn, confirm that you have the rewards history.\n\n### Reconciliation with Other Sources\n\nIf possible, reconcile your Bybit data with other sources of information. Your bank account statements should match the fiat deposits and withdrawals that appear on Bybit. Movements between Bybit and other wallets should have correspondence in the histories of both platforms.\n\nIf you detect significant discrepancies, investigate before proceeding. You may be missing exports, have used products you forgot about, or there may be operations that were not exported correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Special Cases and Complex Situations\n\n### Copy Trading and Social Trading\n\nIf you have used Bybit's copy trading function to automatically copy other traders' operations, each operation executed in your account has the same tax implications as if you had performed it manually.\n\nExport the copy trading history from the corresponding section. These operations may not appear in the regular spot or derivatives history, so specifically check this section.\n\n### Liquidations and Margin Calls\n\nIf you have suffered total or partial liquidations of leveraged positions, these represent capital losses that can offset gains. Make sure to include all liquidations in your declaration.\n\nThe derivatives history file should show liquidations, but verify that they are complete. Bybit also sends email notifications of liquidations that you can use as backup.\n\n### Bonuses and Referral Programs\n\nTokens received for referring new users, participating in promotions or reaching VIP levels constitute income that must be declared. Look for these records in the rewards or airdrops history.\n\n### Internal Transfers Between Products\n\nWithin Bybit, you can transfer funds between different products: from spot to derivatives, from your main account to Earn, etc. These internal transfers do not generate taxation, but it's important to correctly identify them so as not to confuse them with tax operations.\n\nInternal transfers usually appear in the transaction history with descriptions such as \"Internal Transfer\" or \"Transfer to Derivatives\". Do not include them as tax events.\n\n---\n\n## Preparation of Final Tax Report\n\nOnce you have exported, consolidated and verified all your Bybit data, the final step is to prepare a structured document for your declaration.\n\n### Recommended Summary\n\nYour report should include an executive summary with the tax period covered, the total number of operations processed, total capital gains (spot and derivatives operations), total capital losses, returns from Earn and staking, and the value of your portfolio as of December 31.\n\nNext, include a detail of capital gains with each sale or exchange operation, showing the date, asset, quantity, sale price, acquisition cost (calculated by FIFO) and the resulting gain or loss.\n\nSeparately, list investment income: each Earn, staking or airdrop reward with its date, quantity received, valuation price and value in euros.\n\nFinally, include the detail of balances as of December 31 to evaluate the form 721 obligation.\n\n### Documentation to Keep\n\nKeep for at least four years (preferably six) all original CSV files exported from Bybit, screenshots of the export process, your spreadsheets with processing and conversions, the sources of historical quotes used, and any relevant communication with Bybit.\n\nThis documentation protects you against possible AEAT requirements and demonstrates that you have made a diligent declaration based on official information.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Data from Other Exchanges\n\nIf in addition to Bybit you use other exchanges like [Binance](/en/blog/como-exportar-historial-binance-correctamente) or [Kraken](/en/blog/como-obtener-csv-kraken-tributacion), remember that the FIFO method must be applied globally to all your operations, not per platform.\n\nThis means that before calculating the gains of a sale on Bybit, you need to consider all previous purchases of that asset on any exchange or wallet. The process requires consolidating data from all your sources into a single chronological record.\n\nIf you have operations on multiple platforms, the complexity of the calculation increases significantly. In these cases, [a professional portfolio analysis service](/servicios/analisis-carteras) can save you many hours of work and ensure that the calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Exporting Correctly is the First Step\n\nCorrectly exporting all your Bybit data is the first fundamental step for a correct tax declaration. Without complete and organized data, it's impossible to correctly calculate capital gains, identify the returns to be declared or demonstrate the traceability of your operations before the tax authority.\n\nThe key points you should remember are to export all types of data (spot, derivatives, conversions, earn, deposits and withdrawals), verify that you cover the complete period from your first operation, convert dates from UTC to Spanish local time, consolidate multiple files into a single record ordered chronologically, convert all values to euros with documented exchange rates, correctly apply the FIFO method considering all your sources, and keep the original documentation for years.\n\nIf the process seems overwhelming or you don't have time to do it correctly, at Cleriontax we offer [specialized portfolio analysis services](/servicios/analisis-carteras) that include importing and processing your Bybit data, certified FIFO calculation according to Spanish regulations, generation of reports ready for form 100, determination of form 721 obligations and support for AEAT requirements.\n\n[Request your Bybit tax analysis](/contacto)\n\nComply with the tax authority with the peace of mind that your data has been processed by experts.\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is for informational and educational purposes only.
