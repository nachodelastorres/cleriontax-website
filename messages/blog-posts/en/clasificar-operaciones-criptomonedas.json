  "content": "Correctly classifying cryptocurrency transactions is one of the most important steps in the tax process. It determines whether a transaction generates a **capital gain**, an **income**, or a simple internal transfer with no tax impact.\n\nAn incorrect classification can alter your tax return and cause **discrepancies with the AEAT**. Therefore, it’s essential to apply the proper tax criteria to each type of transaction based on its nature and the applicable regulations.\n\n---\n\n## Why Tax Classification Is Essential\n\n**Tax classification** determines how each transaction is taxed and where it should be included in your tax return. Selling Bitcoin (capital gain) is not the same as earning staking rewards (investment income).\n\n### Impact on Your Tax Return\n\nEach type of transaction has:\n\n- **Different tax rates:** Capital gains are taxed under the savings base (19%–28%), while other types of income may have different treatment\n- **Different tax forms:** Some are declared in Form 100, others may require additional information\n- **Different calculation methods:** FIFO for capital gains, market valuation for income\n\nAn incorrect classification can lead to:\n\n- Miscalculating the taxable base\n- Applying incorrect tax rates\n- Omitting transactions that must be declared\n- Including movements with no fiscal impact\n\n---\n\n## Types of Transactions Recognized by the AEAT\n\nThe **Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT)** mainly distinguishes three categories of cryptocurrency transactions:\n\n### 1. Capital Transactions\n\n**Definition:** Purchases, sales, or exchanges of cryptocurrencies that generate capital gains or losses.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Selling Bitcoin for euros\n- Exchanging Ethereum for another cryptocurrency (swap)\n- Using cryptocurrencies to purchase goods or services\n- Token conversions on decentralized exchanges\n\n**Taxation:**\n\n- The **FIFO** method applies to determine acquisition cost\n- Gains are taxed under the **savings base** (19%–28%)\n- Losses can be offset against other capital gains\n\n### 2. Investment Income (Rendimientos del Capital Mobiliario)\n\n**Definition:** Income earned from staking, lending, or rewards from decentralized protocols.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Staking rewards from ETH, ADA, DOT, etc.\n- Yield farming or liquidity provision rewards\n- Income from crypto lending\n- Airdrops received as rewards or incentives\n\n**Taxation:**\n\n- Valued at **market price** at the time of receipt\n- Taxed as **investment income**\n- Declared annually, even if not converted to euros\n\n### 3. Non-Taxable Operations\n\n**Definition:** Internal movements between wallets or transfers between your own accounts that have no tax implications as long as they can be properly justified.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Transferring Bitcoin from Binance to your hardware wallet\n- Moving Ethereum from MetaMask to Ledger\n- Consolidating funds into a single wallet\n- Deposits and withdrawals on exchanges\n\n**Important:**\n\n> **These operations DO NOT create a taxable event**, but they must be properly documented to avoid confusion with the AEAT. It’s crucial to prove they are internal movements, not sales or exchanges.\n\n---\n\n## How to Determine the Tax Nature of Each Transaction\n\nTo classify each transaction correctly, the AEAT requires analyzing the **economic purpose and outcome** of the operation.\n\n### Key Questions to Classify a Transaction:\n\n1. **Does ownership of the asset change?**\n   - Yes → Probably a capital transaction\n   - No → May be an internal movement\n\n2. **Is there any income or yield generated?**\n   - Yes → Could be investment income\n   - No → Analyze whether it’s an exchange or transfer\n\n3. **Is there an economic exchange?**\n   - Yes → It’s a taxable exchange (swap)\n   - No → Likely a non-taxable movement\n\n4. **Can you prove it’s an internal movement?**\n   - Yes (same ownership, controlled wallets) → Non-taxable\n   - No → Must be treated as a capital transaction\n\n### Practical Example of Classification\n\n**Transaction:** You move 1 ETH from Coinbase to Uniswap and exchange it for 2000 USDC.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **First part** (Coinbase → Uniswap):\n   - **Internal movement:** You’re transferring funds between platforms you control\n   - **No tax impact**\n\n2. **Second part** (ETH → USDC on Uniswap):\n   - **Swap/exchange:** You’re trading one asset for another\n   - **Generates a capital gain or loss**\n   - The gain/loss is calculated as the difference between the selling value of ETH and its acquisition cost\n\nFor example, a **token swap on a DEX** is a taxable exchange, whereas **moving funds between personal wallets** is not.\n\n### Information Needed for Proper Classification\n\nThe key is to have **complete information**:\n\n- ✅ **Exact dates** of each transaction\n- ✅ **Market prices** at the time of the operation\n- ✅ **Source and destination addresses** (to identify internal transfers)\n- ✅ **Purpose of each transaction** (buy, sell, swap, staking, etc.)\n- ✅ **Transaction hash** for blockchain traceability\n- ✅ **Exchange or protocol** where it occurred\n\nOnly with this can you ensure **traceability and consistency** in your tax report.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes in Crypto Tax Classification\n\n### Error #1: Not Treating Swaps as Exchanges\n\nOne of the most frequent mistakes is treating **crypto swaps** as simple conversions with no tax implications, when in reality, they are **taxable exchanges**.\n\n**Correct:** Each swap generates a gain or loss that must be calculated using FIFO.\n\n### Error #2: Failing to Declare Staking Rewards\n\nAnother common mistake is not declaring staking or airdrop rewards, assuming they are **‘unrealized’** until sold.\n\n**Correct:** Staking rewards must be declared annually at their market value when received.\n\n### Error #3: Confusing Internal Movements with Sales\n\nIt’s also common to incorrectly classify internal transfers as real buy/sell operations.\n\n**Correct:** Internal wallet transfers DO NOT create taxable events if you can prove you control both wallets.\n\n### Error #4: Not Applying FIFO Correctly\n\nMany investors calculate capital gains incorrectly by not properly applying FIFO, leading to inaccurate results.\n\n**Correct:** The first cryptocurrencies you bought are considered the first ones sold.\n\nThese errors can cause **inconsistencies and alerts** during AEAT reviews.\n\n---\n\n## How Cleriontax Ensures Accurate Classification\n\nAt **Cleriontax**, we analyze every transaction from both a technical and tax perspective.
