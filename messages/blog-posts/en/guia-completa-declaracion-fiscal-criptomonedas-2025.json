  "content": "Declaring cryptocurrencies in Spain has become an unavoidable obligation for any investor. Since 2014, the **General Directorate of Taxes (DGT)** has established clear criteria on the taxation of crypto assets, and the AEAT’s control has become increasingly thorough.\n\n> **Executive Summary:** This comprehensive guide will help you understand how to declare your cryptocurrency investments to the AEAT. You’ll learn to calculate gains using the FIFO method, understand Forms 100, 720, and 721, and discover legal tax optimization strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Why Declaring Cryptocurrencies Is Mandatory\n\nFailing to correctly declare your cryptocurrency transactions can lead to serious consequences:\n\n- **Financial penalties** ranging from 50% to 150% of undeclared amounts\n- **Late filing surcharges** between 5% and 20%\n- **Interest on arrears** calculated from the deadline\n- **Tax crimes** when the amount defrauded exceeds €120,000\n\nBeyond avoiding legal issues, declaring correctly allows you to **optimize your tax situation** and ensure you pay exactly what is legally required.\n\n---\n\n## The Three Main Tax Scenarios\n\n### 1. Capital Gains and Losses: Form 100\n\nThis is the most common scenario for most cryptocurrency investors. A **capital gain or loss** occurs in the following situations:\n\n- When you sell cryptocurrencies for euros or another fiat currency\n- When you exchange one cryptocurrency for another (e.g., Bitcoin for Ethereum)\n- When you use cryptocurrencies to buy goods or services\n- When you receive cryptocurrencies as payment for your work\n\n#### Calculating Gains: The Mandatory FIFO Method\n\nThe **AEAT** requires applying the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) method. This means the first cryptocurrencies you bought are the first ones considered sold when you make a transaction.\n\nThe basic formula is:\n\n```\nGain or Loss = Sale Price - Purchase Price (FIFO)\n```\n\n#### Detailed Practical Example\n\nImagine the following Bitcoin operations:\n\n**Purchases made:**\n\n- January 2023: 0.5 BTC at €20,000 (total cost: €10,000)\n- March 2023: 0.3 BTC at €25,000 (total cost: €7,500)\n\n**Sale made:**\n\n- June 2023: 0.6 BTC at €30,000 (total income: €18,000)\n\n**Applying FIFO:**\n\nFirst, 0.5 BTC from January are sold:\n\n- Income for 0.5 BTC: 0.5 × 30,000 = €15,000\n- Acquisition cost: €10,000\n- Partial gain: €5,000\n\nThen, 0.1 BTC from the March purchase are sold:\n\n- Income for 0.1 BTC: 0.1 × 30,000 = €3,000\n- Acquisition cost: 0.1 × 25,000 = €2,500\n- Partial gain: €500\n\n**Total capital gain: €5,500**\n\n#### 2025 Tax Rates\n\nCapital gains are taxed under the **Savings Base** as follows:\n\n| Taxable Base | Applicable Rate |\n|---|---|\n| Up to €6,000 | 19% |\n| €6,000 to €50,000 | 21% |\n| €50,000 to €200,000 | 23% |\n| €200,000 to €300,000 | 27% |\n| Over €300,000 | 28% |\n\nIn the previous example, with a €5,500 gain, the tax due would be:\n\n```\n5,500 × 21% = €1,155\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Investment Income: Staking and Lending\n\nWhen you earn passive income from your cryptocurrencies, it is considered **investment income** and also taxed under the Savings Base.\n\nCommon cases include:\n\n- **Staking:** Participating in transaction validation on Proof-of-Stake blockchains (Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot), receiving rewards\n- **Lending:** Loaning cryptocurrencies through DeFi (Aave, Compound) or CeFi (Nexo, BlockFi) platforms, earning interest\n- **Crypto savings accounts:** Offered by exchanges such as Binance Earn or Crypto.com Earn\n\n#### Taxation Moment\n\nAccording to AEAT’s interpretation, taxation occurs when you **effectively receive** the tokens as rewards, meaning:\n\n- When you withdraw staking rewards to your personal wallet\n- When you end a lending period and receive the interest\n- When rewards become available and usable\n\n#### Staking Example\n\nSuppose you stake 10 ETH in 2023 and earn 0.5 ETH as a reward. At the time of receipt, ETH’s market value is €1,800.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Investment income: 0.5 × 1,800 = **€900**\n- Tax: 900 × 19% = **€171**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Other Capital Gains\n\n#### Airdrops: Free Tokens\n\nAirdrops are free distributions of tokens, usually as promotional campaigns or participation rewards.\n\n**Tax Treatment:** Considered a capital gain at their market value upon receipt.\n\n#### Hard Forks: Blockchain Splits\n\nWhen a blockchain splits and you automatically receive new tokens (e.g., Bitcoin Cash in 2017), taxation differs from airdrops.\n\n**AEAT’s criterion:** New tokens from a hard fork are taxed only **when sold or exchanged**, not upon receipt. Their acquisition cost is considered zero.\n\n#### Cryptocurrency Mining\n\nTax treatment depends on whether mining is **professional** or **occasional**:\n\n**Professional mining** (regular economic activity):\n\n- Requires registration as self-employed\n- Income taxed as business income\n- Related expenses deductible (electricity, equipment, depreciation)\n- Requires Social Security contributions\n\n**Occasional mining** (hobby):\n\n- No registration required\n- Considered a capital gain upon sale of mined coins\n- Acquisition value: market value at the time of mining\n\n---\n\n## Form 720: Declaration of Foreign Assets\n\n### Obligation to File\n\nYou must submit **Form 720** if the total value of your cryptocurrencies held on foreign exchanges or platforms exceeds **€50,000** as of December 31.\n\n### What Qualifies as Foreign\n\nAny exchange, custody platform, or service **not domiciled in Spain** is considered foreign.\n\n**Must be declared in Form 720:**\n\n- Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com\n- Bitpanda, Bitstamp, Gemini, Bybit\n- Any international exchange\n\n**Not required:**\n\n- Personal non-custodial wallets (Ledger, Trezor, MetaMask)\n- Spanish exchanges\n- Cryptocurrencies held directly without intermediaries\n\n### Key Details for Form 720\n\n**Filing period:** January 1 to March 31 of the following year.\n\n**Nature:** A purely **informative** declaration. It does not generate direct taxation or additional payment.\n\n**Penalties:** Extremely severe. Non-compliance or incorrect submission carries a minimum fine of **€10,000**, potentially much higher depending on undeclared amounts.\n\n> **Important:** While Form 720 doesn’t involve paying taxes, failing to file or filing it incorrectly can result in serious consequences. Compliance is essential if your foreign holdings exceed €50,000.\n\n---\n\n## Form 721: New Reporting for Service Providers\n\n**Form 721** was introduced in 2023 as part of the enhanced crypto tax control framework.\n\n### Who Must File\n\nThis form is mandatory only for:\n\n- Entities providing **virtual currency custody services**\n- Spanish exchanges or those with tax presence in Spain\n- Providers offering **crypto-fiat exchange services**\n- Platforms facilitating crypto asset operations\n\n### Individual Users\n\nIndividual investors **do NOT have to file** Form 721. The obligation lies with service providers, not end users.\n\n---\n\n## Special Cases and Common Questions\n\n### What if I Only Bought and Hold?\n\nIf you’ve only bought and hold cryptocurrencies (the **HODL** strategy), you **don’t have to declare gains** under IRPF, as no gain or loss has been realized.\n\nHowever, you must file **Form 720** if your foreign exchange holdings exceed €50,000 as of December 31.\n\nThis holding strategy effectively **defers taxation** — you pay only when you sell and realize gains.\n\n### Do Wallet Transfers Incur Tax?\n\n**No.** Transferring cryptocurrencies between wallets you own does not trigger a taxable event. It’s equivalent to moving money between your own bank accounts.\n\n**Non-taxable examples:**\n\n- Transferring Bitcoin from Binance to your Ledger wallet\n- Moving Ethereum from MetaMask to Trezor\n- Consolidating funds from multiple wallets into one\n- Transferring crypto between exchanges you use\n\nOnly transactions involving a **disposal** (sale, exchange) or **income generation** are taxable.\n\n### Offsetting Gains and Losses\n\n**Capital losses** can be offset against capital gains within the same fiscal year. Remaining losses can be carried forward and offset over the **next four years**.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**2023:**\n\n- Ethereum sale gain: +€8,000\n- Solana sale loss: -€3,000\n- Net taxable base: €5,000\n\n**2024:**\n\n- Gains: +€2,000\n- Losses: -€6,000\n- Net base: -€4,000 (net loss)\n- Losses carried forward to 2025–2028: €4,000\n\n### NFT Taxation\n\nNFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are treated similarly to cryptocurrencies but with nuances:\n\n**Occasional buying/selling:** Taxed as capital gains at 19%–28% under the Savings Base.\n\n**Professional artists creating and selling NFTs:** Considered business income and requires self-employment registration.\n\n**NFT-for-crypto exchange:** Treated as a taxable swap for both parties.\n\n**Receiving NFTs as payment:** Taxed as employment or business income depending on the context.\n\n### High-Frequency Trading\n\nIf you engage in active trading with hundreds or thousands of annual transactions, the AEAT may consider it a **regular economic activity**, not just investment.\n\n**This entails:**\n\n- Registration as self-employed\n- Income taxed as business income, not capital gains\n- Monthly Social Security contributions\n- Formal accounting requirements\n\n**AEAT criteria include:**\n\n- **Volume:** Over 500 annual trades may indicate professional activity\n- **Frequency:** Daily or intraday trading\n- **Revenue:** If it’s your primary income source\n- **Infrastructure:** Use of professional tools or offices\n- **Organization:** Level of planning and systematization\n\n> **Professional Tip:** If you perform more than 100 trades per month consistently, consult a specialized tax advisor to assess your case and determine the correct tax regime.\n\n---\n\n## Legal Tax Optimization Strategies\n\n### Tax-Loss Harvesting: Crystallizing Losses\n\nThis strategy involves selling loss-making assets before the fiscal year ends to offset realized gains, thereby reducing your taxable base.\n\n#### Example\n\nAs of December 15, 2025:\n\n**Realized gains:**\n\n- Bitcoin sales gain: +€15,000\n\n**Unrealized portfolio losses:**\n\n- Ethereum: -€4,000\n- Solana: -€2,000\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. Sell Ethereum before December 31 to realize a €4,000 loss\n2. Taxable base for 2025 becomes: 15,000 - 4,000 = €11,000\n3. Tax saving: 4,000 × 21% = **€840 saved**\n\nOptional: Rebuy Ethereum in January 2026. The 2025 tax loss remains valid.\n\n> **Important:** Although Spain doesn’t have a U.S.-style “wash sale rule,” waiting a few days before repurchasing is advisable to avoid AEAT scrutiny.\n\n### Splitting Sales Across Years\n\nIf you have substantial gains, consider spreading sales over multiple tax years to avoid higher tax brackets.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**Option A – Sell all in one year:**\n\n- Gain: €55,000\n- Tax: (6,000 × 19%) + (44,000 × 21%) + (5,000 × 23%) = €11,530\n\n**Option B – Split over two years:**\n\n- Year 1: €27,500 → €5,655 tax\n- Year 2: €27,500 → €5,655 tax\n- **Total: €11,310 → Saving: €220**\n\nWhile modest, savings can be significant for larger portfolios.\n\n### Incorporation via a Company Structure\n\nFor large crypto portfolios (over €100,000) with professional activity, structuring investments through a company may offer tax advantages.\n\n**Potential advantages:**\n\n- Corporate tax (23–25%) vs. personal income tax (up to 28%)\n- Ability to reinvest profits without personal taxation\n- Improved business cash flow management\n- Deductible operational expenses\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- More complex accounting and audit obligations\n- Setup and maintenance costs\n- Double taxation on dividends\n- Greater scrutiny and reporting requirements\n\n> **Conclusion:** Company structuring only makes sense for significant assets and professional operations. A specialized tax advisor should assess your specific situation.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Process for Filing\n\n### Step 1: Gather Information\n\nExport from every exchange and wallet:\n\n- Full transaction history (CSV, Excel, or API)\n- Exact dates and times\n- Values in euros using exchange rate at transaction time\n- Fees per transaction\n- Operation type (buy, sell, swap, transfer, staking, etc.)\n\n### Step 2: Consolidate and Clean Data\n\nThis is labor-intensive but crucial:\n\n- Combine all CSVs into a single format\n- Remove duplicates\n- Reconcile transfers between platforms\n- Verify final balances match real ones\n- Standardize data formats\n\n> **Note:** Specialized platforms like Cleriontax fully automate this process.\n\n### Step 3: Apply FIFO Methodology\n\nFor each sale or swap, calculate acquisition cost via FIFO:\n\n- Keep chronological order of all purchases\n- Compute FIFO cost basis per sale\n- Track crypto balances continuously\n\n### Step 4: Generate Supporting Documents\n\nPrepare:\n\n- Detailed list of transactions with gain/loss per trade\n- Summary of total capital gains/losses\n- Summary of investment income (staking, lending, etc.)\n- Supporting docs for Form 720 if applicable\n- Exchange screenshots or PDFs\n\n### Step 5: File the Declaration\n\n**Deadlines:**\n\n- **Form 100 (IRPF):** April 11 – June 30\n- **Form 720:** January 1 – March 31\n\n**Submission methods:**\n\n- Online with digital certificate or Cl@ve PIN\n- In-person at AEAT offices (Form 100 only)\n\n---\n\n## Recent Regulatory Updates\n\n### EU MiCA Regulation\n\nThe **MiCA** (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation took effect progressively in 2024–2025, standardizing crypto laws across the EU.\n\n**Main impacts:**\n\n- Stronger regulation and supervision of exchanges\n- Capital requirements for providers\n- Better consumer protection\n- Standardized fiscal reporting between countries\n- Specific stablecoin regulation\n- Greater transparency\n\n### DAC8 Directive: Automatic Information Exchange\n\n**DAC8** establishes automatic tax information exchange for crypto across the EU, similar to bank reporting under CRS.\n\n**For investors, this means:**\n\n- Exchanges automatically report to tax authorities\n- Cross-border data sharing\n- Concealing crypto operations is nearly impossible\n- Transparency ensures legal security for compliant investors\n\n> **Regulatory Conclusion:** The era of “the AEAT won’t find out” is over. Full transparency and exhaustive oversight make proper declaration the only safe long-term option.\n\n---\n\n## Final Checklist: Ready to File\n\nBefore filing, ensure you:\n\n- [ ] Have complete transaction history from all platforms\n- [ ] Know exact purchase dates and prices\n- [ ] Know exact sale/exchange details\n- [ ] Applied FIFO correctly\n- [ ] Calculated staking/lending income separately\n- [ ] Checked if Form 720 applies (over €50,000 abroad)\n- [ ] Have all supporting documents\n- [ ] Considered legal tax optimization strategies\n\n---\n\n## When You Need Professional Help\n\nCrypto tax declarations can be complex, especially if:\n\n- You’ve done 100+ trades\n- Used multiple exchanges (CEX and DEX)\n- Participated in complex DeFi protocols\n- Staked across several networks\n- Struggle to apply FIFO correctly\n- Want to optimize legally\n- Combine crypto with traditional assets\n- Deal with high transaction volumes\n\n### Why Choose Cleriontax\n\nAt **Cleriontax**, we specialize in the intersection of **tax and technology**.
