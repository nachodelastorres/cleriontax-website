  "content": "**Kraken** is one of the most respected and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in Europe, especially popular among Spanish users for its support for native EUR pairs (BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR) and tax transparency.\n\nHowever, when it comes time to prepare your **tax return** and you need to justify your cryptocurrency operations to the Spanish tax authority (AEAT), many users face the same critical question: How do I correctly export all my Kraken data for tax purposes?\n\nUnlike Binance, which is more complex, Kraken offers a significantly simplified data export system. But still, there are specific steps you must follow to ensure you get **all relevant tax information** without missing any operations.\n\nExporting your Kraken data incorrectly can result in:\n\n- Incomplete tax returns that lead to sanctions from the tax authority\n- Inability to justify operations and gains to the AEAT\n- Incorrect calculations of acquisition cost using the FIFO method\n- Loss of unreported staking rewards\n- Lack of traceability for deposits and withdrawals\n\nIn this **complete and up-to-date guide**, we'll teach you exactly how to export all your Kraken data in CSV format, what information each file contains, how to interpret it correctly, and how to organize it for your **precise and complete tax return**.\n\n---\n\n## Why is Kraken Different from Other Exchanges?\n\n### Kraken's Tax Advantages for Spanish Users\n\nKraken has several characteristics that significantly differentiate it from other exchanges for users in Spain:\n\n**1. Direct EUR Pairs:**\n\nUnlike Binance, which primarily uses USDT as the divisor, Kraken offers **direct euro pairs** like BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR, and ADA/EUR. This means your operations are recorded directly in euros, eliminating the need for additional conversions and reducing rounding errors.\n\nThis feature is crucial for taxation because:\n- The price is recorded directly in the declaration currency (EUR)\n- You reduce the risk of deviations from exchange rate fluctuations\n- It facilitates justification to the tax authority of the prices used\n- It greatly simplifies data processing for FIFO\n\n**2. European Regulation and Transparency:**\n\nKraken is regulated in Europe and complies with much stricter transparency and reporting standards. The platform actively cooperates with European tax authorities, including Spanish ones.\n\nThis has direct tax implications:\n- Exported data is documentarily reliable and defensible before the tax authority\n- Kraken may be required by the AEAT to provide information about Spanish users\n- The company maintains detailed records for years\n- Exports are backed by internal audit systems\n\n**3. Permanent Transaction History:**\n\nUnlike some exchanges that delete histories after a certain time, Kraken maintains permanent records of all your operations from when you created your account. This means that even if you were trading 5 years ago, you can still export that information.\n\n### Specific Tax Obligations with Kraken in Spain\n\nAs a Kraken user in Spain, you must comply with tax obligations similar to those of other exchanges, but with some particularities derived from the nature of the platform:\n\n**Capital Gains from Trading:**\n\nEach buy-sell operation on Kraken generates a capital gain or loss subject to taxation. Since Kraken offers direct EUR pairs, you have an advantage: prices are already in the declaration currency.\n\nThese gains are taxed in the **savings base with rates of 19%, 21%, 23% and 27%** depending on the total volume of capital gains for the year. If you made gains on Kraken during 2024, you must declare them in your [form 100 using the correct FIFO method calculation](/en/blog/como-declarar-criptomonedas-renta-2025).\n\n**Staking Rewards:**\n\nKraken offers staking programs for Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot and other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Each reward received constitutes a **capital income** that must be declared as income in the year it is received.\n\nStaking rewards are declared in the **savings base** (although with specific treatment as income). They must be valued at the price of the cryptocurrency on the exact day of receipt.\n\n**Form 721 Obligation:**\n\nIf the total balance of your cryptocurrencies on Kraken (and other exchanges) exceeds **€50,000 on December 31**, you are obligated to file [form 721 for declaration of crypto-assets abroad](/en/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas).\n\nThe penalty for failing to file form 721 is severe: **€1,500 minimum and up to 150% of the undeclared value**. That's why it's essential that when exporting your Kraken data, you also capture the final balance in euros at the end of the fiscal year.\n\n**DAC8 Directive Compliance:**\n\nKraken, as a regulated European exchange, is obligated to communicate information about users to tax authorities under the [DAC8 Directive](/en/blog/directiva-dac8-criptomonedas-exchanges-hacienda). Although this occurs without your intervention, it's important that you're aware that your operations may be automatically reported to the tax authority.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Data You Can Export from Kraken\n\nUnlike Binance, Kraken groups data types in a more simplified way. Let's see what you can export and when you need each type:\n\n### 1. Trade History (Spot Trading)\n\nThe trade history includes all orders you've executed in Kraken's spot market: purchases, sales, and exchanges.\n\nEach operation records:\n- **Exact date and time (UTC):**\n- **Trading pair:** BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR, ADA/USD, etc.\n- **Order type:** Market, Limit, Stop-Loss\n- **Side of the operation:** Buy (purchase) or Sell (sale)\n- **Unit price:**\n- **Executed quantity:**\n- **Fee paid:**\n- **Total value in the reference currency:**\n\n**Tax Importance:**\nThis is the most critical file for your declaration. Each line represents a tax event (capital gain or loss) that must be included in your FIFO calculation.\n\n### 2. Deposit and Withdrawal History (Funding)\n\nThis file includes all fund movements in and out of your Kraken account:\n\n**Deposits (Inbound):**\n- EUR bank transfers you've deposited\n- Cryptocurrency deposits from other wallets\n- Income from commissions or referrals\n\n**Withdrawals (Outbound):**\n- Transfers to your bank account\n- Cryptocurrency sends to other wallets or exchanges\n- Dust conversions that don't appear in the trade history\n\n**Tax Importance:**\nIt's essential for documenting the traceability of your funds and proving the origin of your capital. If the tax authority requires it, this history is your evidence of where the money came from with which you bought cryptocurrencies.\n\n### 3. Conversion and Exchange History\n\nKraken allows you to instantly convert between cryptocurrencies, similar to Binance's Convert function. This file records:\n\n- Origin cryptocurrency and quantity converted\n- Destination cryptocurrency and quantity received\n- Exact date and time\n- Conversion fee or spread\n\n**Tax Importance:**\nEach conversion between cryptocurrencies constitutes a **barter** (exchange of goods), which is a tax event that generates capital gain or loss according to the [correct classification of operations](/en/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas).\n\nThis is a common mistake: many users don't export conversions thinking they're not \"real\" operations. However, from a tax perspective, converting BTC to ETH is just as important as selling BTC for EUR.\n\n### 4. Staking and Rewards History\n\nIf you've participated in proof-of-stake staking on Kraken, you can export:\n\n- Each staking reward received\n- Exact date of receipt\n- Quantity received\n- Market price at that time (although you'll need to find it separately)\n\n**Tax Importance:**\nEach staking reward is a tax income that must be declared as capital income. The AEAT requires that you demonstrate when you received each reward and at what market price.\n\n### 5. Fee History\n\nKraken allows you to see a detailed breakdown of all fees paid, grouped by:\n- Type of fee (trading fee, withdrawal fee, etc.)\n- Currency paid\n- Time period\n\n**Tax Importance:**\nFees are deductible expenses that reduce your taxable base. It's important to document them correctly, especially if you pay fees in cryptocurrencies (for example, if you paid a commission in BTC, that amount should be deducted from the capital gain value).\n\n### 6. Balance Summary (Holdings)\n\nKraken allows you to export a summary of your current holdings or holdings at a specific date:\n\n- Each cryptocurrency\n- Total quantity\n- Current market price or price at the selected date\n- Total value in EUR\n\n**Tax Importance:**\nThis file is crucial for determining whether you need to file form 721 (€50,000 limit). You must export your balances specifically on **December 31 of the fiscal year** you're reporting.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Export Data from Kraken\n\nNow let's see exactly how to export each type of data from your Kraken account.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you start exporting, make sure you have:\n\n- ✅ Access to your verified Kraken account\n- ✅ Identity verification (KYC) completed at the highest level\n- ✅ Two-factor authentication (2FA) activated for security\n- ✅ History viewing permissions enabled\n- ✅ Stable internet connection\n- ✅ Disk space to save multiple CSV files\n- ✅ Updated web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n\n### Step 1: Access Your Data History\n\n1. Log in to your Kraken account (www.kraken.com)\n2. In the upper right corner, click on your name or profile icon\n3. Select \"Settings\" (Configuration)\n4. In the side menu, look for \"Manage Data\" or \"Data Export\"\n5. If you don't see it immediately, it may be under \"Security\" or \"Privacy\"\n\n**Note:** Kraken has reorganized this menu several times in 2024-2025. If you can't find these options, search for \"Account Statement\" instead of \"Data Export\".\n\n### Step 2: Export Trade History (Spot Trading)\n\nThis is the most important export for calculating your capital gains.\n\n**Location:**\n1. Go to \"Settings\" → \"Manage Data\" → \"Export Data\"\n2. Select \"Trades\"\n3. Choose the desired time period (you can export complete years or specific periods)\n4. Select format: **CSV** (not JSON)\n5. Click \"Generate Export\"\n\n**Period Options:**\n- Kraken allows you to export in blocks of up to 1 year\n- If you've traded over multiple years, make separate exports for each fiscal year (2024, 2023, 2022, etc.)\n\n**What You'll Receive:**\n\nA CSV file with columns like:\n```\ntxid,refid,time,type,ordertype,pair,amount,price,cost,fee,volume,margin,misc\n1234567,TRAD1234,2024-01-15T14:32:00Z,buy,limit,XBTEUR,0.05,42500.00,2125.00,6.38,0.05,0,\n```\n\nColumn Explanation:\n- **txid:** Unique transaction ID\n- **refid:** Order reference ID\n- **time:** Date and time in UTC\n- **type:** \"buy\" (purchase) or \"sell\" (sale)\n- **ordertype:** Type of order (limit, market, stop-loss, etc.)\n- **pair:** Trading pair (XBTEUR, ETHEUR, etc.)\n- **amount:** Cryptocurrency quantity traded\n- **price:** Unit price\n- **cost:** Total cost (quantity × price)\n- **fee:** Commission paid\n- **volume:** Volume (equals cost in most cases)\n- **margin:** Indication if it was a leveraged operation\n\n### Step 3: Export Deposit and Withdrawal History (Funding)\n\nThis file documents all the traceability of incoming and outgoing funds.\n\n**Location:**\n1. Go to \"Settings\" → \"Manage Data\" → \"Export Data\"\n2. Select \"Ledger\" (not \"Trades\")\n3. Optionally filter by:\n   - **Asset:** You can export all currencies or just specific cryptocurrencies\n   - **Type:** Filter by \"deposit\" or \"withdrawal\"\n4. Select desired period (1 year maximum per export)\n5. Format: **CSV**\n6. Click \"Generate Export\"\n\n**What You'll Receive:**\n\nA detailed CSV file with each movement:\n```\nrefid,time,type,subtype,aclass,asset,amount,balance,fee,description\nDEP12345,2024-01-10T09:15:00Z,deposit,,,ZEUR,5000.00,5000.00,0.00,EUR Deposit\nWIT67890,2024-01-20T11:30:00Z,withdrawal,,,XXBT,0.5,0.0,0.0005,BTC Withdrawal\n```\n\n**Key Columns:**\n- **refid:** Unique movement ID\n- **time:** Date and time in UTC\n- **type:** \"deposit\" or \"withdrawal\" mainly\n- **asset:** Currency (ZEUR for euros, XXBT for Bitcoin, XETH for Ethereum)\n- **amount:** Amount deposited or withdrawn\n- **balance:** Balance after the operation\n- **fee:** Withdrawal fee (normally 0 for deposits)\n\n> **Important Note:** On Kraken, cryptocurrencies use special codes. XXBT = BTC, ZEUR = EUR, XETH = ETH, XADA = ADA. You'll need to know these codes to correctly process the data.\n\n### Step 4: Export Conversion History\n\nMany users forget to export conversions because they don't appear in the regular trade history. This is a serious tax error.\n\n**Location:**\n1. Go to \"Settings\" → \"Manage Data\" → \"Export Data\"\n2. Look for \"Convert\" or \"Conversion History\"\n3. If you don't see it in Export Data, go to \"Funding\" and look for transactions of type \"convert\"\n4. Alternatively, in the general ledger, filter for transactions with description \"convert\" or \"conversion\"\n\n**If You Can't Find a Direct Option:**\n\nThe conversion export option may not be available in your version of Kraken. In that case:\n\n1. Go to your \"Account Activity\" or \"Funding History\"\n2. Manually filter for conversions (search by \"convert\")\n3. Take screenshots or manually copy each conversion\n4. Create your own CSV with dates, quantities, and converted pairs\n\n### Step 5: Export Staking and Rewards History\n\nIf you've participated in staking, this is a critical file you must not forget.\n\n**Location:**\n1. Go to \"Settings\" → \"Manage Data\" → \"Export Data\"\n2. Select \"Rewards\" or \"Staking History\"\n3. Select the period (you can export several years)\n4. Format: **CSV**\n5. Generate the export\n\n**What You'll Receive:**\n```\ndate,asset,amount,reward_type\n2024-01-15,XETH,0.00523,ethereum2.s\n2024-01-22,XETH,0.00518,ethereum2.s\n```\n\n**Important:** The market price of the reward is NOT included in the Kraken CSV. You'll need to get the price for each reward day separately using:\n- CoinGecko (Historical API)\n- CoinMarketCap\n- Kraken's own price history\n\n### Step 6: Export Balances at Specific Date (December 31)\n\nTo determine if you need to file form 721, you need your total balance on December 31 in euros.\n\n**Location:**\n1. Go to your \"Funding\" or \"Spot Wallet\"\n2. On the balance page, take a screenshot showing:\n   - Each cryptocurrency you own\n   - The exact quantity\n   - The value in EUR (if Kraken shows it) or current EUR price\n3. Note the date of this screenshot (December 31 ideal, or the closest available date)\n4. Save as evidence\n\nAlternatively:\n1. Go to \"Settings\" → \"Account Statement\"\n2. Generate an account statement for the period that includes December 31\n3. This statement will include a final balance summary\n\n---\n\n## How to Interpret Kraken's Exported Data\n\nOnce you've downloaded the CSV files, it's important to understand exactly what the data means and how to process it for your tax return.\n\n### Cryptocurrency Codes on Kraken\n\nKraken uses special codes for cryptocurrencies in its exports. These are the most common:\n\n| Code | Currency | Code | Currency |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| XXBT | Bitcoin | XETH | Ethereum |\n| XADA | Cardano | XDOT | Polkadot |\n| XLTC | Litecoin | XXMR | Monero |\n| ZEUR | Euros | ZUSD | US Dollars |\n| ZGBP | Pounds | ZJPY | Yen |\n\n**Important:** When processing your data, replace these codes with standard names (BTC, ETH, etc.) to avoid confusion.\n\n### Interpretation of Buy and Sell Operations\n\n**Purchase (BUY):**\n```\ntime: 2024-03-15T14:30:00Z\ntype: buy\npair: XBTEUR\namount: 0.05 BTC\nprice: 52000.00 EUR\ncost: 2600.00 EUR\nfee: 5.20 EUR\n```\n\nTax Interpretation:\n- **March 15, 2024** (at 14:30 UTC)\n- You purchased **0.05 BTC**\n- At a unit price of **€52,000**\n- You paid **€2,600** total (not counting commission)\n- Commission: **€5.20**\n- **Total acquisition cost:** €2,600 + €5.20 = €2,605.20\n- Cost per BTC: €52,104\n\nThis information is used to build your purchase record for the FIFO method.\n\n**Sale (SELL):**\n```\ntime: 2024-06-20T10:15:00Z\ntype: sell\npair: XBTEUR\namount: 0.05 BTC\nprice: 58000.00 EUR\ncost: 2900.00 EUR\nfee: 5.80 EUR\n```\n\nTax Interpretation:\n- **June 20, 2024** (at 10:15 UTC)\n- You sold **0.05 BTC**\n- At a unit price of **€58,000**\n- You received **€2,900** (minus commission)\n- Commission: **€5.80**\n- **Net income:** €2,900 - €5.80 = €2,894.20\n\nFollowing the FIFO method:\n- Acquisition cost (purchase of March 15): €2,605.20\n- Sale price (sale of June 20): €2,900\n- **Capital gain:** €2,900 - €2,605.20 = **€294.80**\n- **Tax to pay (19%):** €55.93\n\n### Handling UTC Dates\n\nAll Kraken data is exported in **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**, but Spain is in:\n- **Winter time:** UTC + 1\n- **Summer time:** UTC + 2\n\nThis is especially important for operations just before or after time changes.\n\n**Problem Example:**\n- Operation on Kraken: 2024-12-31 23:45:00 UTC\n- Time in Spain (winter): 2025-01-01 00:45:00\n- **Tax year:** 2025, not 2024\n\nYou must convert each UTC date to Spanish local time to determine the correct tax year.\n\n### Identification of Tax Events\n\n**Events that GENERATE taxation:**\n- ✅ BUY followed by SELL (buy and sell generates gain/loss)\n- ✅ Conversion of crypto to EUR (sale)\n- ✅ Crypto-to-crypto conversion (barter, is a capital gain/loss)\n- ✅ Sale at loss (capital loss that offsets gains)\n- ✅ Staking rewards (capital income)\n\n**Events that DON'T generate immediate taxation:**\n- ❌ Purchase of cryptocurrency (only acquisition cost is recorded)\n- ❌ Deposit to your Kraken account (not tax income)\n- ❌ Withdrawal of cryptocurrency to another wallet (no gain generated)\n- ❌ Transfer between your own Kraken wallets\n\n### Common Problems with Kraken Data\n\n**Problem 1: Decimal Separators**\nKraken uses a period (.) as the decimal separator (English format), but Excel in Spanish uses a comma (,). When opening the CSV:\n- Right-click → File Properties\n- Select \"Encoding\" → Unicode (UTF-8)\n- In Excel: Data → Get Data → From Text File\n- Specify \"Decimal separator: period\"\n\n**Problem 2: Very Small Quantities**\nSome operations may show very small quantities (e.g., 0.00001234 BTC). Make sure your calculation software maintains full precision without rounding.\n\n**Problem 3: Leveraged Operations**\nIf you've done margin trading or futures on Kraken, these operations may have different tax treatment than spot. The \"margin\" field in the CSV will tell you if it was leveraged.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Errors When Exporting Kraken Data (and How to Avoid Them)\n\n### Error 1: Not Exporting Crypto-to-Crypto Conversions\n\nThis is the most common error. Many users forget that Kraken records instant conversions between cryptocurrencies in a different place than the trade history.\n\nConverting 1 BTC to 16 ETH is fiscally a **barter** (exchange of goods) that generates a capital gain or loss. Failing to declare it is:\n- Incomplete (income omission)\n- Punishable by the AEAT\n- Subject to late payment interest\n\n**Solution:**\n- Actively search for \"Conversions\" history in Kraken\n- If you can't find a direct CSV, manually copy each conversion\n- Value each conversion at the EUR price at that time\n- Include all conversions in your FIFO calculation\n\n### Error 2: Forgetting to Include Staking Rewards\n\nIf you've participated in Kraken Staking (especially ETH 2.0), each reward received is a tax income.\n\nFailing to declare them is particularly serious because:\n- The AEAT can cross-check data with Kraken\n- Rewards are recorded with exact date\n- Their omission is easy to detect in an audit\n\n**Solution:**\n- Specifically export \"Rewards\"\n- For each reward, find the EUR price of the cryptocurrency on that exact day\n- Declare each reward as capital income in the corresponding tax year\n\n### Error 3: Not Converting Correctly to Euros\n\nSome Kraken data may be in USD (ZUSD) or GBP (ZGBP) instead of EUR, especially if you traded those pairs.\n\nNot correctly converting to EUR results in:\n- Incorrect declared values\n- Possible sanctions for manifest error\n- Misalignment with information Kraken provides to the tax authority\n\n**Solution:**\n- For USD pairs: find the USD/EUR exchange rate for that exact day\n- Source: European Central Bank, CoinGecko, Kraken historical\n- Example: Sale of 1 ETH at 1,500 USD on 15/03/2024\n  - USD/EUR rate on 15/03: 0.92\n  - EUR price: 1,500 × 0.92 = €1,380\n\n### Error 4: Using Dates Without Converting from UTC\n\nNot converting UTC dates to Spanish local time can result in assigning operations to the wrong tax year.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Convert manually or with Excel: `UTC_Date + 1 hour (winter) + 2 hours (summer)`\n- Use the TIMEVALUE function in Excel for automatic conversion\n- For operations near December 31, especially important\n\n### Error 5: Loss of Commission Data\n\nSome commissions on Kraken may be paid in different currencies. If you don't record them correctly, you unjustifiably reduce the taxable base.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Each commission reduces the capital gain (if in EUR)\n- If the commission is in cryptocurrencies, it must be valued at the price of that day\n- Use the complete \"Ledger\" file to audit all commissions\n\n### Error 6: Not Verifying Balance Coherence\n\nKraken may occasionally have errors or you yourself could have incomplete data. Verifying coherence protects you.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Sum all your BTC deposits\n- Subtract all your BTC withdrawals\n- Sum/subtract buy-sell operations\n- Compare the result with your current balance on Kraken\n- If it doesn't match, investigate what's missing\n\n---\n\n## How to Organize and Process Exported Data\n\nOnce you've downloaded all CSV files, you need to organize them systematically so you can process them correctly.\n\n### Recommended Folder Structure\n\nOrganize your Kraken files clearly and professionally:\n\n```\n📁 Kraken_Tax_2024/\n├── 📁 1_Original_Exports/\n│   ├── 📄 Kraken_Trades_2024.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Kraken_Trades_2023.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Kraken_Ledger_2024.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Kraken_Conversions_2024.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Kraken_Rewards_2024.csv\n│   └── 📄 Kraken_Holdings_2024-12-31.csv\n├── 📁 2_Processed_Data/\n│   ├── 📄 Consolidated_All_Trades.xlsx\n│   ├── 📄 FIFO_Calculations.xlsx\n│   └── 📄 Converted_to_EUR.xlsx\n├── 📁 3_Evidence/\n│   ├── 📄 Export_process_screenshot.png\n│   ├── 📄 Kraken_confirmation_email.pdf\n│   └── 📄 Quotations_used_notes.txt\n└── 📁 4_Final_Report/\n    └── 📄 Kraken_Tax_Summary_2024.xlsx\n```\n\nThis structure allows you to:\n- Save evidence of where the data comes from\n- Keep original data unmodified\n- Document your processing process\n- Facilitate audits if the tax authority requires\n\n### Consolidation and Data Cleaning\n\nIf you've exported multiple files (several years of trades, for example), you need to consolidate them:\n\n**Step 1: Combine Multiple Files of the Same Type**\n1. Open the oldest file in Excel\n2. Copy all rows (without headers) from newer files\n3. Paste them at the end of the first one\n4. Sort by date (\"time\" column)\n5. Verify there are no duplicates\n\n**Step 2: Verify Data Coherence**\n- ✅ All dates are in consistent format\n- ✅ No duplicate records\n- ✅ Final balances of one operation match initial balances of the next\n- ✅ No unexplained time gaps\n\n**Step 3: Add Processing Columns**\n\nCreate additional columns for processing:\n- Local_Date (converted from UTC)\n- Tax_Year (extracted from local date)\n- Price_EUR (manual lookup or tools)\n- Gain_Loss (calculated per FIFO)\n- Operation_Type (tax classification)\n\n### Manual Price Conversion to EUR\n\nFor operations in USD or GBP, you need to obtain historical quotations.\n\n**Method 1: CoinGecko API**\n```\nhttps://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin/history?date=15-03-2024&vs_currencies=eur\n```\nResponds with the EUR price of BTC on March 15, 2024.\n\n**Method 2: CoinGecko Website Manually**\n1. Go to https://www.coingecko.com/\n2. Search for the cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin)\n3. Click \"Historical Data\"\n4. Find the specific date\n5. Copy the EUR price\n\n**Method 3: Kraken Historical Data**\n1. Go to Kraken's charts page\n2. Search for the EUR pair (e.g., BTC/EUR)\n3. Set the date\n4. Read the price\n\n### Calculation of Capital Gains with FIFO Method\n\nThis is the most critical step and where many users make serious errors.\n\n**Complete Example:**\n\n**Purchase History:**\n1. January 10, 2024: You purchase 0.3 BTC at €40,000 = €12,000\n2. February 15, 2024: You purchase 0.5 BTC at €45,000 = €22,500\n3. March 20, 2024: You purchase 0.2 BTC at €50,000 = €10,000\n\n**Sales History:**\n4. June 1, 2024: You sell 0.7 BTC at €52,000 = €36,400\n\n**FIFO Calculation (first purchases = first sales):**\n\n- You sell first the 0.3 BTC from 1/10 (cost: €12,000)\n- You then sell 0.4 BTC from the 0.5 of 2/15 (cost: €22,500 × 0.4/0.5 = €18,000)\n- **Total acquisition cost:** €12,000 + €18,000 = €30,000\n- **Sale income:** €36,400\n- **Capital gain:** €36,400 - €30,000 = **€6,400**\n- **Tax (19%):** €1,216\n\n**Remaining Portfolio Balance:**\n- 0.1 BTC from the 2/15 purchase (cost: €4,500)\n- 0.2 BTC from the 3/20 purchase (cost: €10,000)\n- Total: 0.3 BTC with accumulated cost of €14,500\n\nThis record is essential for future operations.\n\n### Tools to Automate Processing\n\nIf you have many operations, manual processing is impractical.

If you prefer not to process manually, we can do it for you.\n\n---\n\n## Verification of Integrity and Completeness\n\nBefore using your data for your tax return, you must verify that it is complete and coherent.\n\n### Verification Checklist\n\n**Verification 1: Have I Exported Everything?**\n\n- ✅ Trades from all years I've operated on Kraken\n- ✅ Deposits and withdrawals (Ledger) complete\n- ✅ Crypto-to-crypto conversions\n- ✅ Staking rewards (if I participated)\n- ✅ Balances on December 31 for form 721 calculation\n- ✅ Commission data\n\n**Verification 2: Are Balances Coherent?**\n\nManual verification for each major cryptocurrency:\n\n```\nBTC Balance Verified:\nBTC Deposits (from Ledger): +1.5\nBTC Withdrawals (from Ledger): -0.3\nBTC Purchases (from Trades buy): +0.8\nBTC Sales (from Trades sell): -0.9\nCalculated Balance: 1.1 BTC\nActual Balance on Kraken: 1.1 BTC ✅\n```\n\nIf it doesn't match:\n- Missing exported conversions\n- Missing staking transactions\n- BTC commissions not accounted for\n- Transfers between your own internal wallets\n\n**Verification 3: Are All Dates Correct?**\n\n- ✅ Dates in chronological order\n- ✅ No duplicates\n- ✅ No large time gaps without explanation\n- ✅ Dates correctly converted from UTC to local time\n\n**Verification 4: Are They Correctly Valued?**\n\n- ✅ All prices in EUR (or converted to EUR with documented exchange rate)\n- ✅ Commissions included in acquisition cost\n- ✅ Quantities in BTC, ETH, etc. maintain full decimal precision\n\n### Documentation of Sources for Audit\n\nIf the tax authority requires, you must be able to justify:\n\n**1. Origin of Quotations**\n\nCreate a document with notes like:\n```\nOperation: Sale of 0.05 BTC on 15/03/2024\nPrice Used: €52,000\nSource: Kraken historical - BTC/EUR chart\nScreenshot: kraken_btc_eur_15_03_2024.png\n\nOperation: Sale of 1 ETH on 20/05/2024 at 1,500 USD\nUSD/EUR Rate: 0.92 (date 20/05/2024)\nSource: European Central Bank\nEUR Price: 1,500 × 0.92 = €1,380\n```\n\n**2. Export Process**\n\nSave screenshots of the process:\n- Access to \"Settings\" → \"Manage Data\"\n- Selection of data type (Trades, Ledger, etc.)\n- Export generation\n- Kraken confirmation email\n\n**3. File Integrity**\n\nKeep an unmodified copy of the original CSV files (folder \"1_Original_Exports\"). Never edit the originals.\n\n---\n\n## Special Cases and Complex Situations\n\n### What If I Can't Access My Old Kraken Account?\n\nIf you closed your account or lost access and need old data:\n\n**Option 1: Contact Kraken Support**\n1. Go to https://support.kraken.com\n2. Open a ticket requesting historical data export\n3. Provide verification information\n4. The process can take 2-4 weeks\n\n**Option 2: Manual Reconstruction**\n1. Use your bank statements for fiat deposits/withdrawals\n2. Use block explorers (Etherscan, BscScan) for crypto movements\n3. Estimate operations based on your memory\n4. Document that there's missing information but that you made due diligence\n\n### What If I Exported Some Data But Not Completely?\n\nIf you exported only 2024 but have operated since 2021:\n\n**Problem:** You won't be able to correctly calculate the FIFO method because you don't know the acquisition cost of cryptocurrencies bought before 2024.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Try to export data from previous years from Kraken\n2. If Kraken doesn't have data (account closed), reconstruct with blockchain\n3. Document in your return \"Incomplete data from year X due to access impossibility\"\n4. Consult with a tax advisor on how to proceed\n\n### What About Compounded Staking?\n\nIf you've staked for several years and your rewards were automatically reinvested:\n\nEach reward received is a separate tax event with its own date and price.\n\n**Example:**\n- January 1, 2024: You receive 0.05 ETH from staking (value: €100)\n- January 8, 2024: You receive 0.05 ETH from compound staking (value: €103)\n- January to December 2024: 50+ separate staking events\n\nYou must declare ALL of them, not just the annual total.\n\n### Did I Trade with Leverage (Margin) on Kraken?\n\nLeveraged operations may have special tax treatment.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Margin gains/losses are taxed as capital gains\n- Interest paid for the leverage loan is a deductible expense\n- Liquidated positions may have legal implications beyond taxes\n\nIf you have margin operations, consult with a specialized tax advisor.\n\n---\n\n## Preparation of Final Tax Report\n\nOnce you've exported, processed and verified all your Kraken data, the final step is to prepare a consolidated document.\n\n### Recommended Consolidated Summary\n\nCreate a report in Excel or PDF that contains:\n\n**1. Cover and Executive Summary:**\n- Tax period covered (01/01/2024 - 31/12/2024)\n- Kraken username and taxpayer ID of the owner\n- Report generation date\n- Total operations processed\n\n**2.
