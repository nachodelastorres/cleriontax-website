  "content": "**Binance** is the most widely used cryptocurrency exchange in the world, with millions of users in Spain trading daily with Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins and hundreds of altcoins.\n\nBut when it comes time to prepare the **income tax return** or respond to a request from the AEAT, many users face a critical problem: how to correctly export the entire Binance transaction history for tax purposes?\n\nExporting your Binance data incorrectly or incompletely can result in:\n\n- Incorrect tax returns that lead to penalties\n- Inability to justify transactions before the Tax Agency\n- Loss of information about gains and losses\n- Incorrect FIFO method calculations\n- Lack of traceability of your crypto activity\n\nIn this **complete and updated guide for 2025**, we will teach you step by step how to correctly export all your Binance data, which files you need, how to interpret them and how to organize them for your tax return.\n\n---\n\n## Why it is crucial to correctly export your Binance history\n\nThe **Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT)** has access to information about your cryptocurrency operations through various mechanisms: requests to exchanges, banking information, international data matching and blockchain analysis.\n\n### Tax obligations with cryptocurrencies in Spain\n\nAs a Binance user in Spain, you must comply with several fundamental tax obligations. Firstly, every time you sell, exchange or convert cryptocurrencies, you generate a capital gain or loss that must be declared in the [modelo 100 by applying the FIFO method](/blog/como-declarar-criptomonedas-renta-2025). This taxation occurs in the savings base with rates ranging between 19% and 28%, and requires you to know exactly the purchase and sale price of each transaction.\n\nIf the total balance of your cryptocurrencies on Binance exceeds €50,000 as of 31 December, you are required to file the [modelo 721 for declaring cryptocurrencies abroad](/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas). Penalties for not filing this form can range from €1,500 up to 150% of the undeclared amount, and it must be filed in March of the following year.\n\nIn addition, income generated by staking, savings and lending must be declared as investment income in the tax year in which it is received. The AEAT may request detailed justification of any transaction, so the data must be coherent, complete and maintain [absolute traceability of all transactions](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas).\n\n### Consequences of not having a complete history\n\nWithout a correct and complete Binance history, you face multiple tax problems. You will not be able to correctly calculate your capital gains or losses nor apply the mandatory FIFO method in Spain. Nor will you be able to justify the origin of your cryptocurrencies if the Tax Agency issues a request.\n\nThe most serious risk is that the AEAT considers 100% of your sales as capital gains, which can result in excessive tax assessments, surcharges for late filing and significant penalties.\n\n> **Important fact:** If you cannot prove the purchase price of your cryptocurrencies, the AEAT may consider the acquisition cost to be €0, taxing 100% of the sale value.\n\n---\n\n## Types of data you need to export from Binance\n\nBinance generates multiple types of transactions, each with different tax implications. For a complete tax return, you need to export all types of data that have been relevant in your activity.\n\n### 1. Transaction History\n\nThis file includes all deposits and withdrawals in both fiat and cryptocurrencies, distributions and airdrops you have received, promotional program rewards and all fees you have paid on your operations.\n\n**Why you need it:**\n\n- Complete traceability of inflows and outflows of funds\n- Justification of the origin of your cryptocurrencies\n- Identification of airdrops and rewards (taxable income)\n\n### 2. Trade History\n\nThe spot trade history includes all your buy-sell orders in pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/EUR and similar. It records limit, market and stop-limit orders with their respective execution prices, traded quantities, applied fees and exact dates with timestamps.\n\n**Why you need it:**\n\n- Calculation of capital gains and losses\n- Correct application of the FIFO method\n- Documentary basis for the declaration in modelo 100\n\n### 3. Convert History\n\nConversions include all instant exchanges between cryptocurrencies you have made, such as directly converting BTC to ETH. It also covers dust conversions, those small residual amounts that Binance allows you to convert to BNB.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that, from a tax perspective, each conversion between cryptocurrencies constitutes a barter transaction that generates a capital gain or loss that must be declared. This even includes dust conversions which, although involving small amounts, are still taxable events according to the [transaction classification rules](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas).\n\n### 4. Staking and Earn History\n\nIf you have participated in staking of cryptocurrencies such as ETH 2.0, ADA or DOT, or used Binance Savings and Lending products, all rewards received constitute investment income. This income must be valued at the market price on the day of receipt and declared in the corresponding tax year.\n\n### 5. Fee Details History\n\nThe fees you pay on Binance are deductible expenses that reduce the tax base of your capital gains. This includes buy-sell trading fees, withdrawal fees and fees paid in BNB if you have the 25% discount enabled.\n\n### 6. Other relevant histories\n\nIf you have traded futures, options or margin trading, you will also need the full history of these operations, as derivatives profits are taxed as capital gains. Distributions from airdrops, hard forks and referral program rewards must also be properly documented.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step guide: How to export your complete Binance history\n\nNow we are going to see exactly how to export each type of data from your Binance account in a systematic and complete way.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting the export process, make sure you have:\n\n- ✅ Access to your Binance account (web or app)\n- ✅ Completed identity verification (KYC)\n- ✅ Two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled\n- ✅ Stable internet connection\n- ✅ Storage space for multiple CSV files\n\n### Step 1: Export Transaction History\n\n**Access from the web:**\n\n1. Log in to www.binance.com\n2. Click on your profile icon (top right)\n3. Select \"Wallet\" → \"Transaction History\"\n4. Configure the filters:\n   - **Type:** Select \"All\" (or filter by Deposit, Withdrawal, etc.)\n   - **Coin:** You can select \"All\" or a specific cryptocurrency\n   - **Date:** Select the range (maximum 3 months per export)\n5. Click on \"Export Transaction History\" (top right corner)\n6. Select \"Generate\"\n7. You will receive an email when the CSV file is ready\n8. Download and save it with a descriptive name (e.g. `Binance_Transactions_2024_Q1.csv`)\n\n**Important:** If your history spans more than 3 months, you must make **multiple exports** splitting by quarters or months.\n\n### Step 2: Export Trade History\n\nTo export your full spot trading history:\n\n1. Go to \"Orders\" → \"Spot Order\"\n2. Click on the \"Trade History\" tab\n3. Configure the filters:\n   - **Trading pair:** \"All\" or specific pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/EUR, etc.)\n   - **Date:** Date range (maximum 3 months)\n   - **Side:** All (Buy and Sell)\n4. Click on \"Export Complete Trade History\"\n5. Select \"Generate\"\n6. Wait for the confirmation email and download the CSV\n\n**Important columns in the file:**\n\n| Column | Description | Example |\n|---------|-------------|----------|\n| **Date(UTC)** | Date and time in UTC | 2024-03-15 14:32:10 |\n| **Pair** | Trading pair | BTCUSDT |\n| **Type** | Order type | LIMIT, MARKET |\n| **Side** | Buy or sell | BUY, SELL |\n| **Price** | Unit price | 55000.00 |\n| **Executed** | Executed quantity | 0.025 BTC |\n| **Amount** | Total value | 1375.00 USDT |\n| **Fee** | Fee paid | 0.00125 BTC |\n| **Fee Coin** | Fee currency | BTC, BNB |\n\n### Step 3: Export Convert History\n\nInstant conversions are exported from a different section:\n\n1. Go to \"Wallet\" → \"Spot Wallet\"\n2. Click on \"Convert\"\n3. Access \"Convert History\"\n4. Select the date range\n5. Click on \"Export\" and download the CSV\n\n**Do not forget to also export Dust Conversion:**\n\n1. Go to \"Wallet\" → \"Spot Wallet\"\n2. Click on \"Convert to BNB\" (three dots icon)\n3. Access the dust conversion history\n4. Export the history\n\n> **Tax note:** Each dust conversion is a taxable barter that generates a capital gain/loss, even if the amounts are small.\n\n### Step 4: Export Earn History (Savings, Staking, Lending)\n\nTo export your Earn product rewards:\n\n1. Go to \"Earn\" → \"Simple Earn\" (or \"Savings\" if it is an old account)\n2. Click on \"History\"\n3. Select:\n   - **Type:** Interest (interest received)\n   - **Date:** Full range\n4. Export the history in CSV\n\nFor Staking:\n\n1. Go to \"Earn\" → \"Staking\"\n2. Access \"Staking History\"\n3. Filter by Status: All, Asset: All\n4. Export the file\n\nRemember that each reward received is taxable income that must be valued at the market price on the day of receipt, as we explain in our [guide on DeFi taxation](/blog/fiscalidad-defi-espana).\n\n### Step 5: Verify that no data is missing\n\nBefore finishing, verify:\n\n- ✅ You have exported data for all the years in which you have used Binance\n- ✅ There are no \"gaps\" in the dates (consecutive exports without gaps)\n- ✅ You have exported all types of transactions you performed\n- ✅ The CSV files open correctly and contain data\n- ✅ The number of transactions matches your approximate memory\n\n---\n\n## How to interpret Binance CSV files\n\nOnce you have downloaded the files, you need to understand their structure to process them correctly.\n\n### Converting UTC dates to local Spanish time\n\nBinance exports all dates in **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**. For Spain:\n\n- **Winter time:** UTC + 1 hour\n- **Summer time:** UTC + 2 hours\n\nThis is important for determining the correct tax year for operations close to year-end.\n\n**Example:**\n- Trade on Binance: 2024-12-31 23:30:00 UTC\n- Time in Spain (winter): 2025-01-01 00:30:00\n- **Tax year:** 2025 (not 2024)\n\n### Identifying tax-relevant transactions\n\n**Events that generate capital gains/losses:**\n- ✅ SELL (sale of crypto for fiat or stablecoin)\n- ✅ Swap/Convert (crypto-to-crypto exchange)\n- ✅ Dust conversion (conversion to BNB)\n- ✅ Use of crypto to pay fees\n\n**Events that do NOT generate immediate taxation:**\n- ❌ BUY (purchase of crypto with fiat)\n- ❌ Deposit\n- ❌ Internal transfer between Binance wallets\n\n**Events that generate income:**\n- ✅ Staking rewards\n- ✅ Savings interest\n- ✅ Airdrops\n- ✅ Referral rewards\n\nIf you need help to [correctly classify each type of transaction](/blog/clasificar-operaciones-criptomonedas), our specialized guide explains in detail the applicable tax criteria.\n\n### Common problems with Binance CSV files\n\nSome files use `DD/MM/YYYY` format, others `YYYY-MM-DD`. Normalize all dates to a single format before processing using Excel, Google Sheets or [specialized tax tools](/blog/herramientas-rastrear-criptomonedas).\n\nBinance uses a dot (`.`) as the decimal separator, but Excel in Spanish uses a comma (`,`). When opening the CSV, specify the \"English (United States)\" format for numbers.\n\nFees can be paid in different currencies (BTC, BNB, USDT). Each fee must be valued at the market price at the time.\n\nLarge orders may be executed in multiple partial \"fills\". Each fill appears as a separate line in the CSV. To calculate the average acquisition price, use the weighted average.\n\n**Example:**\n- Order: Buy 1 BTC at market price\n- Fill 1: 0.4 BTC at €54,900\n- Fill 2: 0.6 BTC at €55,100\n- **Average price:** (0.4×54,900 + 0.6×55,100) / 1 = €55,020\n\n---\n\n## Critical errors when exporting Binance data (and how to avoid them)\n\nThese are the most common errors users make when exporting their Binance history for tax purposes.\n\n### Error 1: Exporting only one year when you have traded for several\n\nMany users only export data for the current tax year, ignoring previous years. This is serious because you will not be able to correctly calculate the acquisition cost if you bought cryptocurrencies in previous years. The FIFO method requires the full history from your first purchase.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Export data from your **first transaction on Binance** to today\n- If you have been using Binance for years, split the exports by quarters\n\n### Error 2: Forgetting to export conversions (Convert)\n\nSome users only export spot market trades, completely forgetting instant conversions. This is particularly serious because each crypto-to-crypto conversion is a taxable barter.\n\nIf you have frequently used the Convert function, these transactions can represent between 30% and 40% of your total taxable events.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Always export Convert History in addition to Trade History\n- Also include dust conversions even if they involve small amounts\n\n### Error 3: Not exporting staking and earn when you have used these products\n\nStaking income is considered taxable income that must be declared as investment income, taxed in the general base of the IRPF. Failing to declare it constitutes a sanctionable tax omission.\n\n**Solution:**\n- If you have used Staking, Savings, Launchpool, Vault or Lending: export all those histories\n- Value each reward received at the market price on the day\n\n### Error 4: Not converting prices to euros\n\nThe Tax Agency requires that all transactions be declared in **euros (EUR)**, using the exchange rate on the exact day and time of each transaction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- For each transaction, look up the EUR price of the cryptocurrency at that moment\n- Reliable sources: CoinMarketCap Historical Data, CoinGecko, Kraken\n- Tools such as Koinly or CryptoTax do this automatically\n\n### Error 5: Not keeping evidence of exports\n\nIn the event of an audit, you need to prove that the data is official and comes directly from Binance.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Take screenshots of the export process\n- Keep the confirmation emails that Binance sends\n- Note the export date in the file name\n- Keep the original files unmodified\n\n### Error 6: Not verifying the consistency of the exported data\n\nBinance may occasionally have technical issues that generate incomplete exports, missing transactions or duplicate records.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Verify that the number of transactions matches your approximate activity\n- Check that there are no date gaps between consecutive exports\n- Add up the final balances and verify that they match your current wallet\n\n---\n\n## How to organize and process the exported data\n\nOnce you have all the CSV files downloaded, you need to organize them systematically and process them to turn them into useful tax information.\n\n### Recommended folder structure\n\nOrganize your files in a clear hierarchical structure:\n\n```\n📁 Binance_Fiscal_2024/\n├── 📁 1_Originales/\n│   ├── 📄 Binance_Transactions_2024_Q1.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Binance_Transactions_2024_Q2.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Binance_TradeHistory_2024_Q1.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Binance_ConvertHistory_2024.csv\n│   ├── 📄 Binance_StakingHistory_2024.csv\n│   └── ...\n├── 📁 2_Procesados/\n│   ├── 📄 Todas_Transacciones_Consolidadas.xlsx\n│   ├── 📄 Trades_con_EUR.xlsx\n│   └── ...\n├── 📁 3_Evidencias/\n│   ├── 📄 Captura_exportacion_1.png\n│   ├── 📄 Email_confirmacion_Binance.pdf\n│   └── ...\n└── 📁 4_Informe_Final/\n    └── 📄 Resumen_Fiscal_Binance_2024.xlsx\n```\n\n### Consolidation of multiple CSV files\n\nIf you have exported multiple files of the same type (several quarters of Trade History), you need to consolidate them into a single file to facilitate analysis.\n\n**Option 1: Manually with Excel/Google Sheets**\n\n1. Open all CSVs of the same type\n2. Copy and paste the rows into a single sheet\n3. Remove duplicate headers\n4. Sort by date (oldest first)\n5. Verify that there are no duplicates\n\n**Option 2: With processing tools**\n\n- **Python + Pandas:** For technical users\n- **Power Query (Excel):** Automatic integration of multiple CSVs\n- **Google Sheets Apps Script:** Consolidation automation\n\n### Conversion to euros (EUR)\n\nFor each transaction, you need to add columns with values in EUR:\n\n**Columns to add:**\n- Precio_EUR: Unit price in euros\n- Valor_Total_EUR: Total transaction value in euros\n- Comision_EUR: Fee paid in euros\n\n**Sources of historical quotes:**\n\n1. **CoinMarketCap Historical Data:** Go to the cryptocurrency page → \"Historical Data\" → Look up the specific date\n2. **CoinGecko:** Similar to CoinMarketCap with API available\n3. **Exchanges with EUR pairs:** Kraken (BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR), Bitstamp, Coinbase Pro\n\n**For pairs without direct EUR quotation:**\n\n**Example:** You trade ADAUSDT on 15 March 2024\n\n1. Look up the ADA/USDT price on that day: 0.65 USDT\n2. Look up the USDT/EUR price on that day: 0.92 EUR\n3. ADA/EUR price = 0.65 × 0.92 = **0.598 EUR**\n\n### Calculation of gains and losses with FIFO method\n\nSpain requires the use of the **FIFO (First In, First Out) method**: the first cryptocurrencies you bought are the first ones you sell.\n\n**Simplified example:**\n\n**Purchases:**\n- 10/01/2024: You buy 0.5 BTC at €40,000 = €20,000\n- 15/02/2024: You buy 0.3 BTC at €45,000 = €13,500\n- **Total in portfolio:** 0.8 BTC, total cost €33,500\n\n**Sale:**\n- 20/03/2024: You sell 0.6 BTC at €50,000 = €30,000\n\n**FIFO calculation:**\n- You first sell the 0.5 BTC bought on 10/01 (cost: €20,000)\n- Then you sell 0.1 BTC of the 0.3 bought on 15/02 (proportional cost: €13,500 × 0.1/0.3 = €4,500)\n- **Total acquisition cost:** €20,000 + €4,500 = €24,500\n- **Capital gain:** €30,000 - €24,500 = **€5,500**\n- **IRPF to pay (19%):** €1,045\n\n**You have left in your portfolio:**\n- 0.2 BTC (from the purchase on 15/02) with a cost of €9,000\n\n### Tools to automate processing\n\nIf you have many transactions, manual processing is unfeasible. These tools can help you:\n\n**Specialized tax tools:**\n\n1. **Koinly** (recommended)\n   - Direct import from Binance (API or CSV)\n   - Automatic FIFO calculation\n   - Generation of tax reports adapted to Spain\n   - Price: from €50/year depending on number of transactions\n\n2. **CryptoTax, Accointing, CoinTracking**\n   - Support for multiple exchanges\n   - Generation of reports for modelo 100\n\n**Advantages:**\n- ✅ Automatic conversion to EUR with historical quotes\n- ✅ Correct application of the FIFO method\n- ✅ Automatic identification of transaction types\n- ✅ Generation of reports ready for the tax return\n- ✅ Savings of dozens or hundreds of hours of manual work\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- ❌ Cost (although much lower than that of a tax advisor)\n- ❌ Initial learning curve\n- ❌ You need to verify that calculations are correct\n\nIf you prefer a [custom service for processing and analysing your data](/servicios/analisis-carteras), at Cleriontax we specialize in integrating data from multiple sources and generating complete tax reports tailored to your specific situation.\n\n---\n\n## Verification of the integrity of the exported data\n\nBefore using the data for your tax return, you must thoroughly verify that it is complete and consistent.\n\n### Verification checklist\n\n**1. Temporal completeness**\n\n- ✅ The first record matches your first transaction on Binance\n- ✅ The last record is recent (days before export)\n- ✅ There are no date gaps between consecutive files\n\n**2. Balance consistency**\n\nManual verification:\n\n1. Add up all BTC deposits\n2. Subtract all BTC withdrawals\n3. Add/subtract BTC buy-sell transactions\n4. The result must match your current BTC balance on Binance\n\n**Example:**\n```\nBTC deposits: +1.5 BTC\nBTC withdrawals: -0.3 BTC\nBTC purchases (with USDT): +0.2 BTC\nBTC sales (to EUR): -0.8 BTC\nCalculated balance: 0.6 BTC\nActual balance on Binance: 0.6 BTC ✅\n```\n\nIf it does not match, check:\n- Convert transactions not exported\n- Fees paid in BTC\n- Internal transfers between products (Spot ↔ Earn)\n\n**3. Value consistency**\n\n- ✅ All prices are positive\n- ✅ Dates are in chronological order\n- ✅ There are no absurdly high or low values\n- ✅ Fees are consistent (typically 0.1% in Spot)\n\n### Reconciliation with bank statements\n\nFor fiat (EUR) deposits and withdrawals, verify:\n\n1. Export your Transaction History filtered by EUR\n2. Compare with your bank statements\n3. Each fiat deposit to Binance must correspond to an outgoing transfer from your bank\n4. Each fiat withdrawal from Binance must correspond to an incoming transfer to your bank\n\nIf there are discrepancies, they may be due to:\n- Bank fees not reflected on Binance\n- Processing delays (different days)\n- Currency conversions if your bank is in another region\n\n---\n\n## Preparation of the final tax report\n\nOnce you have all the data exported, processed and verified, the final step is to prepare the consolidated document you will use for your tax return.\n\n### Recommended consolidated summary\n\nCreate an Excel or PDF document with:\n\n**1. Executive summary:**\n- Tax period covered\n- Total number of transactions\n- Total capital gain/loss\n- Income received (staking, earn)\n- Final balance as of 31 December\n\n**2. Detail of capital gains:**\n\n| Date | Transaction | Crypto | Amount | Sale Price EUR | Acquisition Cost EUR | Gain/Loss EUR |\n|-------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| 15/03 | BTC sale | BTC | 0.5 | €27,500 | €20,000 | +€7,500 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Total capital gains:** XXXXX€\n\n**3. Detail of income:**\n\n| Date | Type | Crypto | Amount | Value EUR |\n|-------|------|--------|----------|----------|\n| 10/01 | ETH staking | ETH | 0.05 | €115 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Total income:** XXXXX€\n\n**4. Balances as of 31 December:**\n\n| Cryptocurrency | Amount | Price 31/12 | Value EUR |\n|--------------|----------|--------------|----------|\n| BTC | 0.3 | €42,000 | €12,600 |\n| ETH | 2.5 | €2,200 | €5,500 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Total portfolio value:** XXXXX€\n\n*(Important to determine whether you must file [modelo 721](/blog/modelos-100-721-714-criptomonedas))*\n\n### Supporting documentation to keep\n\nKeep for **at least 4 years** (preferably 6 years):\n\n- ✅ All original CSV files downloaded from Binance\n- ✅ Screenshots of the export process\n- ✅ Binance confirmation emails\n- ✅ Spreadsheets with EUR conversions and sources used\n- ✅ Reports generated by tax tools (Koinly, etc.)\n- ✅ Bank statements for fiat deposits/withdrawals\n- ✅ Documentation of historical prices\n\n### Integration into modelo 100 (income tax return)\n\nTo integrate your report into the income tax return:\n\n- **Capital gains (box 389):** Include the total capital gains calculated\n- **Investment income (boxes 027-028):** Include the total income from staking, savings, earn\n\nYou can attach your consolidated summary in PDF format as supporting documentation when you file your return.\n\nIf you need professional help to [prepare your complete tax settlement](/servicios/liquidaciones-fiscales), our team can take care of the entire process from data analysis to filing the official forms.\n\n---\n\n## Special cases and complex situations\n\n### If you have lost access to your old Binance account\n\nLosing access to an old Binance account is more common than it seems.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Account recovery:**\n   - Contact Binance support (support@binance.com)\n   - Provide all possible verification information\n   - The process may take weeks\n\n2. **Reconstruction with banking information:**\n   - Use your bank statements to identify fiat deposits/withdrawals\n   - Use blockchain analysis tools if you made crypto deposits/withdrawals\n   - Estimate transactions based on your memory and old screenshots\n\n3. **Legal advice:**\n   - If Binance does not cooperate, consult a specialized lawyer\n   - In extreme cases, request that Binance provide the data by legal request\n\n### If you used Binance before completing KYC\n\nIf you traded on Binance when it still allowed trading without full verification, you are still required to declare, even if you do not have access to historical exports.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Try to complete KYC now to access histories\n- If that is not possible, reconstruct with blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BscScan, etc.)\n- Declare approximately, documenting the impossibility of accessing exact data\n\n### If you have traded with multiple accounts (yours and family members')\n\nEach Binance account must correspond to a single NIF/DNI. Using another person’s account to trade with your money creates a significant tax problem.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Each person must have their own account verified with their ID card\n- If you have already operated this way, document transfers between bank accounts to prove actual ownership\n\n### If you have done arbitrage between Binance and other exchanges\n\nArbitrage between exchanges adds complexity because it involves multiple cryptocurrency transfers that you must carefully track.\n\n**Example:**\n1. You buy BTC on Kraken at €50,000\n2. You transfer to Binance (no taxation)\n3. You sell on Binance at €50,500 (gain: €500)\n4. You buy ETH with those USDT (taxable barter)\n5. You transfer ETH to Coinbase (no taxation)\n\n**Solution:**\n- Export histories from ALL exchanges used\n- Use tax tools that support multiple exchanges (Koinly, CryptoTax)\n- Clearly identify inter-exchange transfers so as not to duplicate transactions\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: exporting correctly is your tax insurance\n\nCorrectly exporting your complete Binance history is not just a bureaucratic requirement: it is your best protection against possible requests from the Tax Agency and the fundamental basis for a [correct tax return](/blog/errores-declarar-criptomonedas) that minimizes your tax burden within the legal framework.\n\n### Key points to remember\n\n- ✅ **Export EVERYTHING:** Not just trades, also conversions, staking, earn, distributions\n- ✅ **Full period:** From your first transaction to today, without gaps\n- ✅ **Multiple file types:** Transaction History, Trade History, Convert, Earn, etc.\n- ✅ **3-month limit:** Split long exports into quarters\n- ✅ **Conversion to EUR:** Necessary for the Spanish tax return\n- ✅ **Mandatory FIFO method:** First purchases are first sales\n- ✅ **Keep evidence:** Original CSVs + screenshots + confirmation emails\n- ✅ **Verify consistency:** Final balances must match reality\n- ✅ **Consider specialized tools:** Koinly, CryptoTax save a lot of time\n- ✅ **Supporting documentation:** Keep everything for 4–6 years\n\n### Your next step\n\nIf you have exported all your Binance data but feel overwhelmed by processing, FIFO calculation, EUR conversions and preparing your tax return, you are not alone.\n\nAt Cleriontax we are experts in cryptocurrency taxation and exchange data processing.
