  "content": "Liquidity pools are the heart of decentralized finance. Without them, Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap, and practically any DeFi protocol wouldn’t exist. When you deposit your cryptoassets into a pool, you become a **liquidity provider (LP)** and receive LP tokens that represent your share. In exchange, you earn a portion of the fees generated by the pool.\n\nSounds simple. But tax-wise, it’s a maze.\n\n> **What many people don’t realize:** Each phase of your interaction with a liquidity pool creates different tax obligations. The initial deposit is a swap. The accumulated fees are income. And withdrawing creates another capital gain or loss. Ignoring any of these steps can lead to penalties of 50% to 150% of the underpaid tax.\n\nThis article breaks down, step by step, the full tax cycle of LP tokens: from the first euro you deposit to the last cent you withdraw. With numerical examples, real-world cases, and the key points to report correctly to the AEAT.\n\n---\n\n## What a liquidity pool is and why it creates multiple taxable events\n\nA **liquidity pool** is a smart contract that holds reserves of two or more cryptoassets. Users can swap tokens against these reserves, and liquidity providers (LPs) receive fees for facilitating those swaps.\n\n**Basic mechanics:**\n\n1. **You deposit** two tokens in an equivalent proportion (e.g., ETH + USDC at a 50/50 value)\n2. **You receive LP tokens** that certify your participation in the pool\n3. **While you remain**, your position accumulates trading fees\n4. **When you withdraw**, you burn the LP tokens and recover the underlying assets (adjusted by fees and impermanent loss)\n\n**The tax issue:** Each of these steps has specific tax consequences that Spanish rules do not expressly regulate, forcing you to apply general criteria on swaps, income, and capital disposals.\n\n### The three tax moments of a liquidity pool\n\n| Phase | Operation | Tax nature | Treatment |\n|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Entry** | Deposit tokens → Receive LP tokens | Asset swap | Capital gain gain if there is unrealized appreciation |\n| **Holding** | Fees accumulated in the pool | Investment income | Taxed when materialized |\n| **Exit** | Burn LP tokens → Receive tokens | Capital disposal | Gain/loss based on LP value |\n\nThis “triple taxation” structure is what makes pool taxation especially complex. It’s not enough to report when you sell to euros: each intermediate phase can create independent tax obligations.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: The initial deposit (the swap almost nobody reports)\n\nWhen you deposit tokens into a Uniswap, Curve, or any AMM pool, you’re not simply “storing” your crypto. You’re executing a **swap**: you deliver two assets (ETH + USDC) and receive a new one (the LP token).\n\n### Why the deposit creates a capital gain\n\nThe AEAT treats any exchange of one asset for a different one as a capital disposal. By receiving LP tokens in exchange for your original tokens, a taxable event occurs if the market value of what you deliver differs from its acquisition cost.\n\n**Practical example:**\n\n```\nInitial situation:\n- You bought 1 ETH at €2,000 six months ago\n- You bought 2,500 USDC at €1/USDC three months ago\n\nDeposit into ETH/USDC pool (when ETH = €2,500):\n- You deposit: 1 ETH (now worth €2,500) + 2,500 USDC\n- You receive: 100 UNI-V2 ETH/USDC LP tokens\n\nTax calculation for the deposit:\n\nETH:\n- Transfer value: €2,500\n- Acquisition cost: €2,000\n- Capital gain: €500\n\nUSDC:\n- Transfer value: €2,500\n- Acquisition cost: €2,500\n- Capital gain: €0\n\nTotal gain on deposit: €500\nTax (19%): €95\n\nAcquisition value of the LP tokens:\n100 LP = €5,000 (€2,500 ETH + €2,500 USDC)\nUnit cost: €50/LP token\n```\n\n### The most common mistake: \"I haven’t sold anything\"\n\nMany investors believe depositing into a pool is not taxable because they “still have crypto.” This is incorrect. For the AEAT, you disposed of ETH and USDC in exchange for a different asset (an LP token). It is tax-wise equivalent to selling and buying something else.\n\n**Consequences of not reporting:**\n- Unreported capital gains\n- Incorrect tax basis for future operations\n- Potential 50%-150% penalty if the tax authority detects the omission\n\n### Special cases on deposit\n\n**Stablecoin pools:**\nIf you deposit USDC + USDT into Curve’s 3pool, the gain is usually close to €0 because stablecoins do not fluctuate significantly. However, it is still a taxable event that must be recorded.\n\n**Asymmetric (single-sided) deposit:**\nSome protocols allow depositing a single token. The protocol converts it internally into the two pool tokens. This creates two taxable events: first the internal swap, then the deposit.\n\n**Multi-asset pools:**\nIn pools like Balancer with 4+ tokens, each deposited token generates its own independent capital gain/loss.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Holding in the pool (fees and returns)\n\nWhile your funds remain in the pool, two economic phenomena occur with different tax implications: **fee accumulation** and **impermanent loss**.\n\n### Pool fees: when are they taxed?\n\nLiquidity pools generate fees every time someone swaps. These fees are distributed proportionally among LPs and accumulate inside the pool, increasing the value of LP tokens.\n\n**Tax treatment of fees:**\n\nThere are two possible interpretations:\n\n**Interpretation 1 (conservative):** Fees are investment income taxed when they materialize (when you withdraw liquidity or claim).\n\n**Interpretation 2 (integrated):** Fees are embedded in the LP token value and are taxed as a capital gain when the LP is disposed of.\n\nIn practice, the second interpretation is the most commonly applied because:\n- Fees are not “paid out” separately in most pools (they are embedded in the LP value)\n- It greatly simplifies the tax calculation\n- It avoids the complexity of valuing fees in real time\n\n**Example of embedded fees:**\n\n```\nInitial deposit:\n- 100 LP tokens valued at €5,000\n- Acquisition cost: €5,000\n\n6 months later (on withdrawal):\n- The 100 LP tokens are now worth €5,400\n- (Difference: €400 of accumulated fees)\n\nTax calculation on withdrawal:\n- Transfer value of LP: €5,400\n- Acquisition cost of LP: €5,000\n- Capital gain: €400\n- Tax: €76 (19%)\n```\n\n### Impermanent loss: the loss you can’t deduct (yet)\n\n**Impermanent loss (IL)** is the difference between keeping your tokens in the pool versus holding them in your wallet. When the price ratio between the two tokens changes, you suffer IL.\n\n**Key tax rule:** Impermanent loss is NOT deductible while you remain in the pool. It is an unrealized loss.\n\n**Visual example:**\n\n```\nInitial deposit:\n- 1 ETH (€2,500) + 2,500 USDC = €5,000 total\n- You receive 100 LP tokens\n\n3 months later (ETH rises to €4,000):\n\nIf you had HODLed:\n- 1 ETH (€4,000) + 2,500 USDC = €6,500\n\nIn the pool (due to AMM rebalancing):\n- ~0.79 ETH (€3,160) + ~3,160 USDC = €6,320\n\nImpermanent loss: €6,500 - €6,320 = €180\n(Loss versus not depositing)\n\nCan you deduct that €180?\nNO. The IL is not realized.\n\nBut if the pool generated €300 in fees:\nReal value in pool: €6,320 + €300 = €6,620\nResult vs HODL: €6,620 - €6,500 = +€120\n(Fees offset IL)\n```\n\n**When IL is realized:**\n\nImpermanent loss becomes a real tax loss only when:\n1. You withdraw liquidity (burn LP tokens)\n2. The value recovered is lower than the acquisition cost of the LP tokens\n\nIf fees exceed IL, there is no tax loss even if you experienced impermanent loss.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Withdrawal (disposal of the LP token)\n\nWhen you exit the pool, you burn your LP tokens and recover the underlying assets. This creates a **capital gain or loss** on the LP tokens.\n\n### Tax mechanics of withdrawal\n\n```\nBasic formula:\n\nGain/Loss = Transfer value of LP - Acquisition cost of LP\n\nWhere:\n- Transfer value = market value of the tokens received\n- Acquisition cost = what you “paid” when depositing (calculated in Phase 1)\n```\n\n**Full withdrawal example:**\n\n```\nDeposit data (6 months ago):\n- You deposited: 1 ETH (€2,500) + 2,500 USDC\n- You received: 100 LP tokens\n- Acquisition cost of LP: €5,000\n- (You already reported €500 gain due to ETH appreciation)\n\nWithdrawal (today):\n- You burn: 100 LP tokens\n- You receive: 0.85 ETH (€3,400, ETH = €4,000) + 3,400 USDC\n- Total value recovered: €6,800\n\nTax calculation:\n- Transfer value of LP: €6,800\n- Acquisition cost of LP: €5,000\n- Capital gain: €1,800\n- Tax (21% second bracket): €378\n\nNew acquisition cost of the tokens received:\n- 0.85 ETH with cost = €3,400 (€4,000/ETH)\n- 3,400 USDC with cost = €3,400 (€1/USDC)\n```\n\n### Special cases on withdrawal\n\n**Partial withdrawal:**\nIf you withdraw only 50% of your position, you apply FIFO to the LP tokens. If all have the same acquisition cost, you allocate proportionally.\n\n```\nYou have 100 LP with total cost €5,000 (€50/LP)\nYou withdraw 40 LP tokens:\n- Cost of the 40 LP: €2,000\n- Value recovered: €2,800\n- Gain: €800\n\nRemaining 60 LP with cost: €3,000\n```\n\n**Withdrawal at a loss (IL > fees):**\n\n```\nDeposit:\n- 100 LP tokens, cost: €5,000\n\nWithdrawal (bear market + high IL):\n- You recover: €4,200 in tokens\n- Capital loss: €800\n\nThis loss IS deductible.\nIt offsets other gains in the year or the next 4 years.\n```\n\n**Withdrawal into a single token:**\nSome protocols allow withdrawing into a single token (e.g., only USDC). This implies an additional internal swap that creates another taxable event.\n\n---\n\n## Pool types and their tax specifics\n\nNot all pools work the same way, and the differences have tax implications.\n\n### Standard 50/50 pools (Uniswap V2, PancakeSwap)\n\n**Features:**\n- Two tokens in a 50/50 value proportion\n- Fungible, standard LP token\n- Fees embedded in the LP token value\n\n**Taxation:** The simplest. The three-phase model described above applies.\n\n### Concentrated liquidity pools (Uniswap V3)\n\n**Features:**\n- Liquidity provided within specific price ranges\n- Position represented by an NFT (not a fungible token)\n- Higher capital efficiency but higher IL risk\n\n**Special taxation:**\n- The position NFT is treated as a unique asset\n- If price moves out of range, you stop earning fees (no new taxable event)\n- When you close the position, you calculate gain on the NFT as a unique asset\n\n```\nUniswap V3 example:\n\nOpening the position:\n- You deposit 1 ETH + 3,000 USDC in the 2,800-3,200 USDC/ETH range\n- You receive NFT #12345\n- Acquisition cost of NFT: €6,000\n\nClosing the position:\n- You burn NFT #12345\n- You recover 0.9 ETH + 3,500 USDC = €7,100\n- Gain: €1,100\n```\n\n### Stablecoin pools (Curve 3pool, FRAX)\n\n**Features:**\n- Tokens with similar prices (USDC, USDT, DAI)\n- Low impermanent loss\n- Lower but more stable fees\n\n**Taxation:**\n- Deposit usually creates a gain close to €0\n- Returns mainly come from fees and external rewards\n- Ideal for conservative investors from a tax perspective\n\n```\nCurve 3pool example:\n\nDeposit:\n- 10,000 USDC at €0.99/USDC = €9,900 cost\n- Market value: €10,000\n- Gain on deposit: €100 (minimal)\n\n1 year later:\n- You recover 10,400 tokens (USDC+DAI+USDT)\n- Value: €10,350\n- Gain: €450 (fees - small IL)\n```\n\n### Pools with external incentives (Liquidity Mining)\n\nMany pools offer **additional rewards** in protocol tokens (UNI, CRV, CAKE) on top of trading fees.\n\n**Taxation of rewards:**\n\n| Reward type | Tax moment | Nature | Tax rate |\n|----------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|\n| Trading fees (in pool) | On LP withdrawal | Capital gain | 19%-28% |\n| Incentive tokens (manual claim) | On claim | Investment income | 19%-28% |\n| Auto-compound rewards | Each reinvestment | Income + new acquisition | 19%-28% |\n\n**Example with CRV rewards:**\n\n```\nYou deposit into the Curve ETH/stETH pool:\n- 100 LP tokens, cost: €10,000\n- You stake the LP in Curve’s gauge\n\nOver 6 months:\n- Monthly claims: total 200 CRV\n- Value at claim: average €0.50/CRV = €100\n- Investment income: €100\n- Tax: €19\n\nOn LP withdrawal:\n- Value recovered: €11,500\n- Gain on LP: €1,500\n- Tax: €315 (21%)\n\nCRV inventory:\n- 200 CRV with cost €100 = €0.50/CRV\n```\n\nFor a more detailed guide on farming and rewards, see our article on [how yield farming is taxed in Spain](/blog/yield-farming-como-tributa-espana).\n\n---\n\n## Practical calculation: a full liquidity cycle case\n\nLet’s follow a complete real-life case, from the initial purchase of tokens to the final sale into euros.\n\n### Investor profile\n\nMaría buys ETH and USDC, deposits them into a Uniswap pool, receives liquidity mining rewards, and finally sells everything to euros.\n\n### Timeline of operations\n\n**January 2024: Initial purchase**\n```\n- Buys 2 ETH at €2,200/ETH = €4,400\n- Buys 4,400 USDC at €1/USDC = €4,400\n- Total invested: €8,800\n```\n\n**February 2024: Deposit into the pool**\n```\nETH is now worth €2,500/ETH\n\nDeposits into the Uniswap ETH/USDC pool:\n- 2 ETH (value: €5,000)\n- 5,000 USDC (needs to buy 600 more)\n- Additional purchase: 600 USDC at €1 = €600\n\nReceives: 200 UNI-V2 ETH/USDC LP tokens\n\nTax calculation for the deposit:\n\nETH:\n- Transfer value: €5,000\n- Acquisition cost: €4,400\n- Gain: €600\n\nUSDC:\n- Transfer value: €5,000\n- Acquisition cost: €5,000 (€4,400 + €600)\n- Gain: €0\n\nTotal gain on deposit: €600\nTax Q1: €114 (19%)\n\nAcquisition cost of LP tokens:\n200 LP = €10,000 (€50/LP)\n```\n\n**February–July 2024: Liquidity mining**\n```\nShe stakes the LP tokens in a Uniswap farm\nMonthly UNI claims:\n\n- Feb: 20 UNI @ €8 = €160\n- Mar: 22 UNI @ €7 = €154\n- Apr: 18 UNI @ €9 = €162\n- May: 21 UNI @ €6 = €126\n- Jun: 19 UNI @ €7 = €133\n- Jul: 20 UNI @ €8 = €160\n\nTotal rewards: 120 UNI = €895\nInvestment income: €895\nTax (19%): €170.05\n\nUNI inventory: 120 tokens\nAverage cost: €7.46/UNI\n```\n\n**August 2024: Withdrawal from the pool**\n```\nETH is now worth €3,200/ETH\n\nShe burns 200 LP tokens:\n- She receives: 1.7 ETH (€5,440) + 5,440 USDC\n- Total value: €10,880\n\n(Note: Less ETH and more USDC than initially = IL due to ETH rising)\n(But total value increased due to accumulated fees)\n\nTax calculation on withdrawal:\n- Transfer value of LP: €10,880\n- Acquisition cost of LP: €10,000\n- Gain: €880\n- Tax (19%): €167.20\n\nNew inventory:\n- 1.7 ETH with cost €5,440 (€3,200/ETH)\n- 5,440 USDC with cost €5,440\n- 120 UNI with cost €895\n```\n\n**September 2024: Sale to euros**\n```\nShe sells everything:\n\n1.7 ETH at €3,500/ETH = €5,950\n- Cost: €5,440\n- Gain: €510\n\n5,440 USDC at €1 = €5,440\n- Cost: €5,440\n- Gain: €0\n\n120 UNI at €10 = €1,200\n- Cost: €895\n- Gain: €305\n\nGains on sale: €815\nTax (19%): €154.85\n```\n\n### María’s annual tax summary\n\n| Concept | Tax base | Type | Tax |\n|----------|---------------|------|----------|\n| Gain on pool deposit | €600 | Capital gain | €114.00 |\n| UNI rewards (claims) | €895 | Investment income | €170.05 |\n| Gain on pool withdrawal | €880 | Capital gain | €167.20 |\n| Gain on ETH sale | €510 | Capital gain | €96.90 |\n| Gain on UNI sale | €305 | Capital gain | €57.95 |\n| **TOTAL** | **€3,190** | | **€606.10** |\n\n**María’s economic result:**\n- Initial investment: €8,800 + €600 = €9,400\n- Final proceeds: €5,950 + €5,440 + €1,200 = €12,590\n- Gross profit: €3,190\n- Taxes paid: €606.10\n- **Net profit: €2,583.90 (27.5% net return)**\n\n---\n\n## Common tax mistakes with LP tokens\n\nThese are the most common mistakes we detect in [portfolio analyses with liquidity positions](/servicios/analisis-carteras):\n\n### Mistake 1: \"The deposit isn’t taxable, I’m just moving my crypto\"\n\n**Incorrect.** Depositing into a pool is a swap: you deliver tokens A+B and receive an LP token. If the market value of A or B changed since purchase, there is a capital gain.\n\n**Consequence:** Unreported gains. If the tax authority detects discrepancies in your crypto wealth, it can open an audit.\n\n### Mistake 2: \"I report everything together when I sell to euros\"\n\n**Incorrect.** Each phase has its own tax moment:\n- Deposit: when you deposit\n- Rewards: when you claim\n- Withdrawal: when you burn LP\n- Sale: when you convert to fiat\n\n**Consequence:** Incorrect timing. Income and gains must be allocated to the tax year in which they arise, not when you cash out to euros.\n\n### Mistake 3: \"Impermanent loss gives me deductible losses\"\n\n**Incorrect while you remain in the pool.** IL is unrealized. You can only deduct it upon withdrawal if the value recovered is lower than the acquisition cost of the LP tokens.\n\n**Consequence:** Reporting unrealized losses can be rejected by the AEAT and lead to penalties.\n\n### Mistake 4: \"LP tokens are worthless, they’re just a receipt\"\n\n**Incorrect.** LP tokens are assets with market value. They represent your claim on the pool’s tokens plus accumulated fees. They have an acquisition cost (what you deposited) and a transfer value (what you recover).\n\n**Consequence:** Not tracking LP tokens makes it impossible to calculate gains correctly when withdrawing.\n\n### Mistake 5: \"I use pool value to calculate my wealth\"\n\n**Partly correct.** For Modelo 721 (reporting crypto held abroad), yes, you must use the market value of your position on December 31. But for gains/loss calculations, you use historical acquisition cost.\n\nTo learn more about Modelo 721 and DeFi positions, see our [guide on Modelo 721 and cryptocurrencies](/blog/modelo-721-criptomonedas).\n\n### Mistake 6: \"Pool fees are like bank interest\"\n\n**Conceptually similar, but tax-wise different.** Liquidity pool fees are not “paid out” separately like deposit interest. They are embedded in the LP token value and are taxed as a capital gain when you dispose of the LP, not as investment income.\n\n**Exception:** Liquidity mining rewards (UNI, CRV, etc.) are taxed as income when you claim them.\n\n---\n\n## LP tokens and Modelo 721: reporting obligations\n\nIf the total value of your crypto held abroad exceeds €50,000 on December 31, you must file **Modelo 721**.\n\n### How to report LP tokens in Modelo 721\n\nLP tokens must be reported at their **underlying market value**, not by the “number” of LP tokens.\n\n```\nExample as of December 31:\n\nPool positions:\n- 500 ETH/USDC LP tokens (represent 2 ETH + 6,000 USDC)\n  ETH = €3,500 → 2 × €3,500 = €7,000\n  USDC → €6,000\n  LP value: €13,000\n\n- 1,000 stETH/ETH LP tokens on Curve\n  Underlying value: €15,000\n\n- Unclaimed rewards: 200 CRV @ €0.60 = €120\n\nTotal DeFi positions: €28,120\n\nOther crypto assets:\n- 5 ETH in wallet: €17,500\n- 3,000 USDC on exchange: €3,000\n\nTotal crypto: €48,620 → Does NOT exceed €50,000\n\nIf ETH had been at €4,000:\n- ETH/USDC LP: €14,000\n- ETH in wallet: €20,000\n- Total: €52,120 → Modelo 721 IS mandatory\n```\n\n### Deadline and penalties\n\n- **Deadline:** until March 31 of the following year\n- **Minimum penalty:** €10,000 for not filing\n- **Extended statute of limitations:** 10 years (instead of 4) if you don’t file\n\n---\n\n## Tools for tracking LP tokens\n\nHandling liquidity pool taxation manually is complex. These tools help:\n\n### For position visualization\n\n- **DeBank:** Excellent for viewing current LP token value across multiple chains\n- **Zapper:** Clear interface, good detection of Uniswap, Curve, Balancer pools\n- **APY.Vision:** Specialized in tracking IL and pool returns\n\n### For data export\n\n- **Etherscan/PolygonScan:** Export deposit/withdrawal transactions\n- **The Graph:** APIs to pull historical pool data\n- **Dune Analytics:** Custom queries for advanced analysis\n\n### For tax calculation\n\nAutomatic tools have significant limitations with LP tokens:\n- They don’t always detect the deposit as a swap\n- They incorrectly value the LP acquisition cost\n- They don’t integrate accumulated fees well\n\nFor portfolios with multiple liquidity positions, [professional DeFi portfolio analysis](/servicios/analisis-carteras) ensures:\n- Correct detection of each tax phase\n- Accurate valuation of LP tokens at each point in time\n- Integration of fees and IL into gain/loss calculations\n- Auditable reports for the AEAT\n\nYou can see more options in our [comparison of tools to track cryptocurrencies](/blog/herramientas-rastrear-criptomonedas).\n\n---\n\n## Main protocols and their specificities\n\n### Uniswap\n\n**V2 (classic pools):**\n- Standard ERC-20 LP token\n- Straightforward taxation under the 3-phase model\n- Fixed 0.3% fee\n\n**V3 (concentrated liquidity):**\n- Position as an NFT\n- Higher tax complexity due to price ranges\n- Possibility of being \"out of range\" (no fees generated)\n\n### Curve Finance\n\n**Special features:**\n- Pools optimized for stablecoins (low IL)\n- Gauge voting system (veCRV)\n- CRV rewards taxed on claim\n\n**Specific taxation:**\n- Locking CRV for veCRV is a swap\n- Reward boosts do not change the tax nature\n- Bribes received for voting are taxed as income\n\n### Balancer\n\n**Special features:**\n- Pools with more than 2 tokens\n- Configurable weights (not necessarily 50/50)\n- LP tokens represent multiple assets\n\n**Specific taxation:**\n- On deposit, each token creates its own gain/loss\n- Internal rebalancing does not create additional taxable events\n- BAL rewards are taxed as income\n\n### PancakeSwap (BSC)\n\n**Special features:**\n- Very low gas fees\n- Syrup pools for CAKE staking\n- Lottery and predictions system\n\n**Specific taxation:**\n- Same treatment as Uniswap V2\n- CAKE from Syrup pools is income\n- Lottery and predictions are taxed as gains (not exempt like traditional lotteries)\n\n---\n\n## Tax-efficient strategies for LP tokens\n\n### 1. Document from the first deposit\n\nFor each interaction with a pool, record:\n- Transaction hash\n- Tokens deposited and amounts\n- EUR value at the exact moment\n- LP tokens received\n- Date and time\n\nThis is essential to calculate acquisition cost correctly.\n\n### 2. Batch reward claims\n\nEach claim creates a taxable event. If you claim daily small amounts, you’ll have hundreds of records.\n\n**Strategy:** Accumulate rewards and claim monthly or quarterly. Fewer records, same total taxation.\n\n### 3. Consider withdrawal timing\n\nIf you have significant gains in the pool, evaluate:\n- Do you have capital losses in the same year to offset?\n- Is it better to withdraw in December or wait until January?\n- Does the market suggest future fees will offset IL?\n\n### 4. Use stablecoin pools to simplify\n\nStablecoin pools (Curve 3pool, FRAX) typically generate:\n- Minimal gain on deposit (stable prices)\n- Very low IL\n- More predictable returns\n\nTax-wise they are much easier to manage.\n\n### 5. Keep separate accounting per pool\n\nEach pool is an independent “asset.” Keep separate records:\n- Uniswap V2 ETH/USDC pool\n- Curve stETH/ETH pool\n- PancakeSwap USDC/USDT pool\n\nDo not mix calculations across different pools.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ: Liquidity pool taxation in Spain\n\n### Is depositing into a liquidity pool taxable even if I don’t sell to euros?\n\n**Yes.** The deposit is a swap (you deliver tokens, you receive LP tokens). If the market value of the deposited tokens differs from their acquisition cost, there is a capital gain. This happens regardless of whether you later convert to euros.\n\n### How do I calculate the acquisition cost of my LP tokens?\n\n**Add up the market value** of all tokens you deposited at the time of deposit. If you deposited 1 ETH (valued at €2,500) + 2,500 USDC, the acquisition cost of your LP tokens is €5,000.\n\n### Are pool fees taxed as income or as capital gains?\n\n**As capital gains**, embedded in the LP token value. When you withdraw liquidity, the difference between what you recover and the acquisition cost includes the accumulated fees. They are not reported separately.\n\n### What about liquidity mining rewards (UNI, CRV, CAKE)?\n\n**As investment income**, at the market value at the time of claim. They are different from pool fees: rewards are actively claimed and taxed at that time.\n\n### Can I deduct impermanent loss?\n\n**Only when you withdraw liquidity**, if the value recovered is lower than the acquisition cost of the LP tokens. While you remain in the pool, IL is an unrealized, non-deductible loss.\n\n### How do I report Uniswap V3 LP positions (NFTs)?\n\n**As a unique asset.** The NFT represents your entire position. When you close it, you calculate gain/loss by comparing the value recovered with the acquisition cost of the NFT (what you deposited when creating the position).\n\n### Do I have to report my LP tokens in Modelo 721?\n\n**If your total crypto exceeds €50,000 on December 31, yes.** LP tokens are reported at their underlying market value (the value of the tokens they represent at that time).\n\n### How does pool “rebalancing” affect my taxes?\n\n**It does not create an additional taxable event.** The AMM’s automatic rebalancing is internal to the pool. You only pay tax when you deposit (initial swap) and when you withdraw (disposal of the LP). Intermediate proportion changes are not reported.\n\n### What if the protocol is hacked and I lose my LP tokens?\n\n**It is a deductible capital loss.** You must be able to prove you had the position and that the hack caused the loss. Keep: deposit hash, incident documentation, and any protocol communications.\n\n### Can I use LIFO instead of FIFO for LP tokens?\n\n**No.** Spanish rules require FIFO (First In, First Out) to calculate capital gains on cryptoassets. If you have multiple deposits into the same pool, the earliest deposited units are the first considered disposed of.\n\n### How do I document my positions for the tax authorities?\n\n**Keep transaction hashes** for each deposit, claim, and withdrawal. Complement with explorer screenshots (Etherscan) showing amounts and values. For complex portfolios, consider [professional analysis services](/servicios/analisis-carteras) that generate auditable reports.\n\n### What should I do if I didn’t report LP token operations in prior years?\n\n**Regularize as soon as possible.** Options: amended return (if the filing period hasn’t closed), voluntary late filing (after deadline, lower penalty), or wait for an audit (higher penalty). See our guide on [crypto tax filing mistakes](/blog/errores-declarar-criptomonedas) for more details.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: LP tokens require rigorous tracking from day one\n\nLiquidity pools offer attractive yield opportunities, but their tax complexity is significant. Each deposit is a swap. Each withdrawal is a disposal. And fees, rewards, and impermanent loss add extra layers that must be handled correctly.\n\n**Keys to correct LP token taxation:**\n\n1. **The deposit is taxable**: Don’t ignore unrealized gains when entering the pool\n2. **Fees are embedded**: Taxed as a capital gain upon withdrawal\n3. **Rewards are income**: Taxed on claim at the value at that moment\n4. **IL is only deductible on exit**: Not before\n5. **Each pool is a separate asset**: Keep independent accounting\n6. **FIFO is mandatory**: For multiple positions in the same pool\n7. **Modelo 721 if you exceed €50,000**: Include the underlying value of your LP\n\n**Recommended next steps:**\n\n- **If you have pool positions**: Confirm you’ve documented the acquisition cost of each LP token\n- **If you haven’t reported correctly**: Request a [DeFi portfolio analysis](/servicios/analisis-carteras) to assess pending obligations\n- **If you need tax settlements**: Our [tax settlement service](/servicios/liquidaciones-fiscales) prepares the forms ready to file\n- **For ongoing advisory**: [Specialized tax advisory](/servicios/asesoria-fiscal-criptomonedas) supports you throughout the year\n\nReporting LP tokens correctly not only avoids penalties: it gives you real control over your tax situation and lets you make informed decisions about when to enter or exit positions.\n\n---\n\n## Do you have LP tokens and questions about how to report them?\n\nAt Cleriontax we specialize in liquidity pool taxation and complex DeFi positions.
